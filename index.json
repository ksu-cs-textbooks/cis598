Prerequisites CIS 596: CIS 560, ENTRP 340 and senior standing in computer science. Students may enroll in CIS courses only if they have earned a grade of C or better for each prerequisite to those courses.\nCIS 598: CIS 560 and senior standing in computer science. Students may enroll in CIS courses only if they have earned a grade of C or better for each prerequisite to those courses.\nCourse Overview Directed studies: selection, investigation and report on some topic not covered in prior courses; may include an implementation and/or experimentation component; may be done in collaboration with other students. Completion of a final report with literature review and project evaluation.\nCourse Description In this course, students will complete a project, either individually or in small groups, under the supervision of a faculty advisor. The project will integrate concepts from prior courses, but also include a growth component including material not covered in prior courses.\nStudents will create and deliver several presentations throughout the semester on the status of the project, and will also be responsible for developing design documents and other artifacts. At the end of the semester, students will present their work in a public presentation graded by the faculty advisor.\nMajor Course Topics Software Engineering methodologies Software Design Documents \u0026amp; Artifacts Public Speaking \u0026amp; Presentation of Technical Information Planning and Iterating on a Large Software Project Taking a Project from Idea to Completion Demonstrating Independent Learning \u0026amp; Continuing Growth in Computer Science Student Learning Outcomes After completing this course, a successful student will be able to:\nAnalyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program\u0026rsquo;s discipline Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions Course Structure The course meets in person Mondays from 3:30 - 4:20 PM in DUR 1066. Students should attend all in-person course sessions. In-person sessions will primarily be used for student presentations throughout the semester.\nCourse work hours will be Wednesdays and Fridays from 3:30 - 4:20 PM in DUR 1066 and online via Zoom. Attendance at these work hours is optional, but highly recommended. It is a good time to work on your project, ask questions, and get advice. The instructors will be available during these times to answer questions about the class or provide project assistance.\nThe Work There is no shortcut to becoming a great programmer. Only by doing the work will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful computer scientist. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.\nDeliverables Project Overview \u0026amp; Requirements Presentation - typically during the first and second month of the semester, each student will give a short 8-10 minute presentation introducing their chosen project, and discuss the requirements needed to complete the project. Project Design Presentation - typically during the third and fourth month of the semester, each student will give a short 8-10 minute presentation discussing the design of their project. This should include various relevant design artifacts, such as UML diagrams, GUI mockups, API specifications, and database ER diagrams. Final Project Advertisement - students will develop a single slide/image and abstract to be used for advertising their final project presentations. Presentation - during the final weeks of the semester, students will schedule a final project presentation. That presentation will be advertised through the department and given publicly. The student\u0026rsquo;s faculty advisor will grade the final project presentation. Artifacts - at the end of the semester, students must submit the full source code of their project, presentation materials, design documents, and a short writeup detailing the project, it\u0026rsquo;s completion status, and any future work to be done should another student choose to continue and build upon the project. Grading Since this is a project-based course with few deliverables, grading will be handled differently than most other college courses. Your final letter grade will reflect your overall performance in the course, including attendance, in-class presentations, public presentations, adherence to timelines, consistent progress throughout the semester, and the quality of the final project artifacts. Grading will be done in consultation between course instructors and a student\u0026rsquo;s faculty advisor.\nA rough estimate of the relative grading importance of each deliverable is given below:\n15% - Overview \u0026amp; Requirements Presentation 15% - Design Presentation 70% - Final Project Presentation \u0026amp; Artifacts Specifications Grading The two in-class presentations will be graded using specifications grading. Put simply, the instructors will rate how well the presentation meets the specifications given and the expectations of the instructors.Therefore, students will be given one of the following four ratings:\nExceeds Expectations Meets Expectations Needs Revision Incomplete Students who receive a Needs Revision or Incomplete rating will be given one chance to redo the presentation during one of the online course work hours later that week.\nGrade Letter Deductions Since this is a senior-level course, points will not be given for things such as attendance and meeting deadlines, since those are expected of students at this level. However, failure to meet these expectations may result in a grade letter deduction at the end of the semester at the sole discretion of the instructors:\nIdentify a project topic and faculty advisor before the deadline. Attend at least 80% of the in-class meeting times. Give a presentation on the scheduled date. Submit the final project advertisement by the deadline. Submit the final project artifacts by the deadline. Reasonable accommodations will be made in case of unforeseen emergencies or university-excused absences. It is always best to reach out to the instructors as soon as you are aware of a situation that may require accommodation.\nCollaboration Policy In general, students are expected to work independently on a project unless given permission from the instructors. Team projects are welcomed, but come with additional expectations to ensure that each student participates fully and the project is appropriately scoped.\nSince this is a project course, it is likely that some code in your project may come from other sources, such as a starter project or documentation. Students are expected to document each instance of code taken from another source through code comments marking the relevant location. The majority of the final project should represent the student\u0026rsquo;s own work.\nLate Work As discussed above, students are expected to adhere to course deadlines. Failure to meet those deadlines may result in a letter grade deduction at the end of the semester.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to get back on track.\nIncomplete Policy Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.\nIf you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor\u0026rsquo;s discretion. See the official K-State Grading Policy for more information. In general, poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade.\nUnless otherwise noted in writing on a signed Incomplete Agreement Form, the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in this course:\nStudents who request an incomplete will have their final grade capped at a C. Students will be given a maximum of 8 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester to complete the course. It is expected that students have completed at least half of the course in order to qualify for an incomplete. Recommended Texts \u0026amp; Supplies Students will make use of GitHub or GitLab for source code management.\nStudents may use their choice of IDEs and software development platforms. Many of them are available in the Computer Science Department\u0026rsquo;s labs. If a particular software or framework is needed but cannot be acquired, consult with the instructors.\nSubject to Change The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.\nStandard Syllabus Statements Info\nThe statements below are standard syllabus statements from K-State and our program.\nAcademic Honesty Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one\u0026rsquo;s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor and Integrity System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: \u0026ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.\u0026rdquo; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.\nFor this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.\nWe reserve the right to use various platforms that can perform automatic plagiarism detection by tracking changes made to files and comparing submitted projects against other students\u0026rsquo; submissions and known solutions. That information may be used to determine if plagiarism has taken place.\nStudents with Disabilities Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor. Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at accesscenter@k-state.edu, 785-532-6441; for K-State Polytechnic campus, contact Julie Rowe, Diversity, Inclusion and Access Coordinator, at jarowe@ksu.edu or call 785-826-2971.\nExpectations for Conduct All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.\nMutual Respect and Inclusion in K-State Teaching \u0026amp; Learning Spaces At K-State, faculty and staff are committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive and supportive learning environment for students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. K-State courses, labs, and other virtual and physical learning spaces promote equitable opportunity to learn, participate, contribute, and succeed, regardless of age, race, color, ethnicity, nationality, genetic information, ancestry, disability, socioeconomic status, military or veteran status, immigration status, Indigenous identity, gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, religion, culture, as well as other social identities.\nFaculty and staff are committed to promoting equity and believe the success of an inclusive learning environment relies on the participation, support, and understanding of all students. Students are encouraged to share their views and lived experiences as they relate to the course or their course experience, while recognizing they are doing so in a learning environment in which all are expected to engage with respect to honor the rights, safety, and dignity of others in keeping with the (K-State Principles of Community)[https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/].\nIf you feel uncomfortable because of comments or behavior encountered in this class, you may bring it to the attention of your instructor, advisors, and/or mentors. If you have questions about how to proceed with a confidential process to resolve concerns, please contact the Student Ombudsperson Office. Violations of the student code of conduct can be reported here. If you experience bias or discrimination, it can be reported here.\nNetiquette Info\nThis is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from this statement from K-State Global Campus, and the Recurse Center Manual. We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.\nOnline communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the context and body language of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker means, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.\nHere are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:\nUse a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic. Subject lines such as \u0026ldquo;Question\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Problem\u0026rdquo; are not helpful. Subjects such as \u0026ldquo;Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python\u0026rdquo; give plenty of information about your topic. Use only one topic per message. If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently. Be thorough, concise, and to the point. Ideally, each message should be a page or less. Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem. It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you\u0026rsquo;ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly. Consider carefully what you write before you post it. Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others. If you are lost, don\u0026rsquo;t know an answer, or don\u0026rsquo;t understand something, speak up! Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won\u0026rsquo;t see that you asked a question. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students. Class discussions are confidential. Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission. Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts. When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response. Do not use all caps. It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed. No feigning surprise. If someone asks a question, saying things like \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe you don\u0026rsquo;t know that!\u0026rdquo; are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad. No \u0026ldquo;well-actually\u0026rsquo;s.\u0026rdquo; If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a \u0026ldquo;well, actually\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don\u0026rsquo;t post a correction just for the sake of being correct. Do not correct someone\u0026rsquo;s grammar or spelling. Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved. Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions. Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor. Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits. They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood. As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the K-State Principles of Community.\nFace Coverings All students are expected to comply with K-State’s face mask policy. As of August 2, 2021, everyone must wear face masks over their mouths and noses in all indoor spaces on university property, including while attending in-person classes. This policy is subject to change at the university’s discretion. For additional information and the latest on K-State’s face covering policy, see this page.\nAcademic Freedom Statement Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff who work together to discover new knowledge, create new ideas, and share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public. Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university\u0026rsquo;s mission.\nMoreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.\nCampus Safety Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members. In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how to follow any emergency directives. To view additional campus emergency information go to the University\u0026rsquo;s main page, www.k-state.edu, and click on the Emergency Information button, located at the bottom of the page.\nStudent Resources K-State has many resources to help contribute to student success. These resources include accommodations for academics, paying for college, student life, health and safety, and others found at www.k-state.edu/onestop.\nStudent Academic Creations Student academic creations are subject to Kansas State University and Kansas Board of Regents Intellectual Property Policies. For courses in which students will be creating intellectual property, the K-State policy can be found at University Handbook, Appendix R: Intellectual Property Policy and Institutional Procedures (part I.E.). These policies address ownership and use of student academic creations.\nMental Health Your mental health and good relationships are vital to your overall well-being. Symptoms of mental health issues may include excessive sadness or worry, thoughts of death or self-harm, inability to concentrate, lack of motivation, or substance abuse. Although problems can occur anytime for anyone, you should pay extra attention to your mental health if you are feeling academic or financial stress, discrimination, or have experienced a traumatic event, such as loss of a friend or family member, sexual assault or other physical or emotional abuse.\nIf you are struggling with these issues, do not wait to seek assistance.\nKansas State University Counseling Services offers free and confidential services to assist you to meet these challenges. Lafene Health Center has specialized nurse practitioners to assist with mental health. The Office of Student Life can direct you to additional resources. K-State Family Center offers individual, couple, and family counseling services on a sliding fee scale. Center for Advocacy, Response, and Education (CARE) provides free and confidential assistance for those in our K-State community who have been victimized by violence. For Kansas State Polytechnic Campus:\nKansas State Polytechnic Counseling Services offers free and confidential services to assist you to meet these challenges. The Kansas State Polytechnic Office of Student Life can direct you to additional resources. University Excused Absences K-State has a University Excused Absence policy (Section F62). Class absence(s) will be handled between the instructor and the student unless there are other university offices involved. For university excused absences, instructors shall provide the student the opportunity to make up missed assignments, activities, and/or attendance specific points that contribute to the course grade, unless they decide to excuse those missed assignments from the student’s course grade. Please see the policy for a complete list of university excused absences and how to obtain one. Students are encouraged to contact their instructor regarding their absences.\nCopyright Notice © The materials in this online course fall under the protection of all intellectual property, copyright and trademark laws of the U.S. The digital materials included here come with the legal permissions and releases of the copyright holders.

	"content": "The major outcome for this course is a project that demonstrates your skills in computer science, software development, and other areas relevant to your chosen degree program. This page provides an overview that will help you get started on your project.\nRecommended Timeline Here is a recommended timeline for your project:\nWeek 1: Identify a project, get a project advisor. Week 2: Report your project topic and advisor. Start developing. Week 3: \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; Complete. Weeks 3-8: Overview \u0026amp; Requirements Presentations \u0026amp; First Round of Development. Week 8: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Complete. Weeks 9-14: Design Presentations \u0026amp; Second Round of Development. Week 14: Schedule Final Presentation \u0026amp; Create Promotional Materials Week 15: Version 1.0 Feature Complete. Weeks 15-16: Final Presentations. Week 16: Submit Final Materials. Choosing a Topic The first major step is to identify a possible topic for your project. It should align with your interests in the field, and it may also fit well with previous courses you\u0026rsquo;ve taken or possibly future career paths. You may also choose to use your project to explore a new topic or framework that you\u0026rsquo;d like to get experience with.\nYou are also welcome to choose to try and duplicate an existing program from scratch, putting your own spin on it and writing the code from scratch. For example, you may choose to try and duplicate the underlying code and features for a popular social network - in effect your project is driven by their design, but you have to figure out how to build it and code it yourself.\nFinally, if you are having trouble finding a topic, consult the Project Ideas folder on Canvas for project ideas that have been submitted or previous projects that could be continued. You can also chat with the course instructors to get some ideas of a project to consider, or if you have an advisor you\u0026rsquo;d like to work with, chat with them for some ideas.\nFinding an Advisor Once you\u0026rsquo;ve identified a project, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to select a faculty advisor to work with. Throughout the semester, you\u0026rsquo;ll meet regularly to discuss your project with your faculty advisor, and follow their guidance to produce a quality product.\nTypically you want to choose a faculty advisor that is familiar with your project area, since they will be most likely to be able to provide good assistance and feedback as you work on your project.\nIf you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure which faculty members may fit well with your project idea, contact the course instructors or consult the information on the CS Faculty webpage.\nNote\nAdvisor Responsibilities Each advisor approaches senior projects differently, but in general your advisor will typically ask you to do the following:\nProvide an overview of the project and a list of features to be developed. Meet weekly to provide status updates on the project. Read or review additional information, research papers, etc. related to your project. Share your code and other project artifacts for review Schedule a final project presentation Initial Artifacts At the very beginning of your project, you should create a few initial artifacts to start the development process:\nWriteup: prepare a short, 1 page writeup that describes your project topic. It should give some basic use-cases and a rough idea of the architecture or platforms you plan on using in the project. Feature Lists: prepare three sets of feature lists for your project: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) or must haves: these are features that must be present in the project for it to function in the basic sense. It usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t include much in the way of user interface beyond the basic interactions, and it may be missing some additional items to make it more useable. A project that has these features could be considered a Minimum Viable Product. Typically you want to have these features completed in the first 8 weeks of development. Version 1.0 or should haves: these are features that should be present in the project for it to be considered complete. This would involve additional usability features or links to other APIs as needed. A project with these features would be considered a 1.0 product, and could be used by others. Typically these features are completed in the second 8 weeks of development. Version 2.0 or would like to haves: these are cool features that would be useful to have in a finalized project, but they may be outside the scope of what is achievable in a single semester. The lack of these features should not impact the useability or functionality of the project. Typically these features are simply listed on the \u0026ldquo;Future Work\u0026rdquo; portion of the final presentation, but if you complete the project ahead of schedule you may consider adding one or more of these features to the project. These artifacts are not \u0026ldquo;set in stone\u0026rdquo; and can be easily adjusted throughout the project. For example, you may find that a feature previously on the Version 2.0 list is not critical, and it moves to an earlier list.\nOngoing Artifacts Once you\u0026rsquo;ve found your project topic and started working, there are a few artifacts that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to keep track of throughout the semester, while continually updating them each week or so:\nTime Log: Each week, record the number of hours spent working on the project, and a brief paragraph detailing the status of the project and major accomplishments for the week. Code Repository: You should be committing regularly to a code repository on GitHub Classroom. At the very least, you should make a commit each day that you work on the project. The repository will be used to confirm that you are consistently making progress on your project. Design Diagrams: For each of the presentations, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to have a set of updated diagrams for your project. This could include UML class diagrams, database entity relationship diagram, API diagrams, GUI mockups, and more. You should strive to keep these documents updated as you work on the project. Hello World The next step in creating a successful project is getting to the \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; stage. This typically involves configuring your development environment, creating a new project or downloading an existing project, and confirming that you can successfully build and run the project in its simplest form. Ideally, you should be at the \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; stage of your project no later than week 3, and ideally much sooner. This is especially important if you are learning how to use a new framework, programming language, or tool, as it may require significant work to get to this stage alone.\nOnce you are at the \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; stage, you are at the point where you can start adding features to your project from the feature lists described above. A great way to think of those feature lists is like the Product Backlog in the agile software methodology - it is a list of project requirements to be completed.\nTip\nProject Scale and Scope One area that many students struggle with is finding a project that has the appropriate scale and scope for a senior project. While there are no clear rules for this, and each student\u0026rsquo;s situation is different, here are some suggestions for finding an appropriately sized project.\nThe course is 3 credit hours, which roughly equates to an expectation of 9 hours of work each week. Across a 16 week semester, that comes to a total of 144 hours, or just over three and a half 40 hour work weeks if you worked on it full time. You\u0026rsquo;ll be tracking your hours worked throughout the semester, and that may help you make sure you are spending enough time on your project. If you are working in a new framework or language, you should work completely through the initial tutorial in the first couple of weeks of class. Your finished project must go significantly beyond what is covered in the tutorial. Typically projects will have 3-4 major features that make up the minimum viable product, and another 3-4 major features for version 1.0. Each feature should require 1-2 weeks of effort to implement. Your advisor and course instructors can help you determine if your proposed project has appropriate scope, or if it needs modification. You should consult with them early on in the process, and continually update them on your progress, especially if your planned features change. Next Steps At this point, you should be well into development on your project. The next page discusses the first presentation to be given.\n"

	"content": "At the end of the semester, each student will give a public Final Presentation that presents all aspects of the completed project.\nOverview The presentation should be roughly 30-45 minutes in length, and cover all aspects of the project. A recommended outline is below:\nIntroduction Background \u0026amp; Related Work Project Requirements Design Documents Project Implementation (Languages, Frameworks, Code Structure) Testing \u0026amp; Evaluation Packaging \u0026amp; Deployment (if applicable) Live Demo Future Work Conclusion Q\u0026amp;A Scheduling Final presentations are typically scheduled during the last week of the semester (sometimes referred to as \u0026ldquo;dead week\u0026rdquo;) or finals week. You should schedule your presentation in consultation with your advisor, since they are required to attend and grade your project.\nThere are two options for presenting your project:\nIn Person: - you\u0026rsquo;ll need to work with the Computer Science office to reserve a conference room for your presentation. Virtual: - you\u0026rsquo;ll schedule a time using Zoom for your presentation. You should schedule the session to last for an hour to include time for setup and Q\u0026amp;A at the end.\nAdvertising Once you\u0026rsquo;ve scheduled a time and location for your presentation, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create two advertising artifacts to promote your presentation:\nA single paragraph abstract describing the project A single image (1920 by 1080 pixels) promoting your presentation Both artifacts should clearly include your name; the title of your project; and the date, time and location of your presentation. These artifacts are due at least one week before your presentation, and no later than two weeks before the end of finals week.\nSample Presentations You can find several previous presentations and completed projects under the Files section on Canvas. Bear in mind that these may or may not be example of good presentations, they are simply ones that have been collected for sharing.\n"

	"content": "At the end of the semester, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to submit all of your project artifacts and information for grading. Here is a helpful checklist of everything that should be submitted:\nInitial Writeup \u0026amp; Feature List (collected via Canvas early in the semester) First Presentation (collected via Canvas when it was presented) Second Presentation (collected via Canvas when it was presented) Advertisement Materials (collected via Canvas before final presentation) All Code \u0026amp; Related Resources Pushed to GitHub Classroom Repository Repository should include a README.md that briefly describes how to compile/run/use the project. Repository should also include final presentation materials (slides, etc.) Completed Time Log (collected via Canvas at the end of the semester) Completed Release Information (collected via Canvas at the end of the semester) Your advisor will also submit feedback on your final project presentation and artifacts. The course instructors will reach out to advisors to collect this information, so students don\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything for this step.\n"
