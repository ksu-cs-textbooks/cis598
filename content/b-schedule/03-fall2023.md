Ben Sherwood

![Image](/images/fall2023/sherwood.png)

The Equivalent Learning Activity (ELA) Platform is a “man-in-the-middle” Node.js web application that consumes an LTI connection from Canvas, and subsequently provides it to an external tool based off of a student’s activity selection. These equivalent learning activities that a student gets to select from all equate to the same learning goal/concept, and thus allows a student to further personalize their learning experience for new concepts. In addition, a student will also have the opportunity to review the other activities that they didn’t originally select if they want further practice with a concept. The application tracks mastery progress for each learning concept, and passes back proper grades to Canvas. I, Ben Sherwood, will be giving a presentation over the ELA Platform on Wednesday, December 13th at 10:15 am inside Engineering Hall room DUE 2168, and also via Zoom at the following link: https://bit.ly/cis598spr23.
