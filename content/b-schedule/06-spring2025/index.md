## MTG DND Card Cost Calculator {#e9}

Camden Green

![Image](images/green.png)

Me and my friends created a custom set of rules to "cost" Magic: The Gathering cards for use in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. The rules are a list of ~100 conditionals and criteria that based on factors like the cards type and mana cost determine a point total you have to pay to acquire that card. This process gets tedious as this is something that needs to be done weekly to an average of ~20 cards. My single page React web app utilizes JSON rules engine as a way to translate the rules into an algorithm while making them very easy to add/remove/modify if changes are made. Not all of the rules are easily implementable and some are impossible to fully complete, so users are also given components to manually modify it themselves if needed.

## Escaplore {#e16}

Sak Lee

![Image](images/lee.png)

Ever since my first encounter with a computer game, I have long desired to develop a game that I have personally designed. This passion has driven me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at Kansas State University, even though I had no prior knowledge in programming. With all the programming knowledge and experiences that I have acquired as a K-State student, I decided to realize my old desire by designing and developing a game for my CIS 598 project. Escaplore is a game that I have personally designed, a dice-roll-based game of mixed-genre, where the players explore an island to escape it. The game title, Escaplore, is a blend of ‘escape’ and ‘explore,’ reflecting the core of the gameplay. Utilizing C# language with Godot Engine, and Visual Studio, I have structured the game under Scene-Tree architecture, in which, the program is formed through a tree of scenes, or in other words, tree of saved states of objects. Together with the implementation of the concept of object-oriented and layered design, I have developed a game that I could call my own. Escaplore is both a fulfillment of my long dream, and a culmination of my academic journey.

## MicroMouse Maze Solving {#e21}

#### Evaluating the Maze-Solving Capabilities of Reinforcement Learning in the MicroMouse Competition

John Woods

![Image](images/woods.png)

The MicroMouse Competition is a robotics competition where fully autonomous robots are tasked with navigating a maze in the shortest possible time. Creating an effective robot requires not only clever hardware design, but also intelligent and efficient software design. In this project, I will be evaluating the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL), a subfield of Machine Learning in which an autonomous agent learns to make decisions in its environment, for solving the maze in this competition. To do so, I developed a custom simulation environment using the Gymnasium Python library to evaluate the performance of RL algorithms from the Stable Baselines 3 library. In addition, I also implemented several traditional graph-based maze-solving algorithms to serve as a baseline comparison. John Woods will be presenting the results on Wednesday, May 14th, 2025, at 3:30pm in DUE 2168 and on Zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a.

## WorkAlert {#e27}

Clint McKenzie & Logan Arnold

![Image](images/arnold_mckenzie.png)

When people think of dangerous jobs, they often think of professions such as a police officer or firefighter that run towards the signs of danger on a daily basis. While these jobs are obviously dangerous, people often don’t think of the dangers of everyday jobs. But professions like caretakers, housekeepers, or home renovators can statistically be just as dangerous due to the chaotic nature of entering somebody else’s home. While other professions have safety equipment to keep employees as safe as possible, service workers require other needs in order to keep them safe. Hence why we created our android mobile application, WorkAlert. The purpose of the app is to allow people who work in potentially dangerous environments, like random people’s homes, to automatically contact their emergency contacts in the event of an emergency.

The Penguin Physics Engine is a 2D physics engine developed by Thomas Rosebrook in C# using MonoGame for use in the creation of game development using the MonoGame framework. The engine is a library that simulates rigid-body dynamics of 2D objects. Users can create various physics objects and designate different behaviors for collisions or even create their own. The project will be presented on Thursday, May 15 at 3:30pm in DUE 2168 or in Zoom via https://bit.ly/cis598s24a.
