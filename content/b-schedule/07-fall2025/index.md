ServiceSync solves this by bringing work orders, technician scheduling, inventory tracking, invoice generation and preventive maintenance into one organized platform. With automated scheduling for preventive maintenance, real-time updates, and clear role-based access, the system helps companies stay efficient, reduce confusion, and keep their work running smoothly. 

## How Random is Pseudorandom? {#e20}

Ryan Welch & Dillon McGinn

![Image](images/cis599.png)

Computers are (by design) completely deterministic - this is great for many situations, but detrimental to one important situation: randomness. Randomness is inherently not deterministic, so computers must improvise in order to generate/collect this random entropy. Are these pseudorandom creation and collection methods employed by moderns OS's (and ChatGPT for a bonus) adequate for use in cryptographic security that we depend on every day?

## Verba {#e1}

Wyatt Morris

## EduVista {#e3}

Taj Ikhlaas

![Image](images/ikhlaas.jpg)

EduVista is a web-based analytics platform that helps instructors make sense of their Canvas LMS data. Built with Python and Streamlit, it solves the problem of having student data scattered across multiple Canvas exports by automatically matching and combining engagement data with gradebook information. The system uses regex pattern matching to categorize assignments (quizzes, labs, homework, etc.) regardless of inconsistent naming in Canvas, then provides interactive dashboards to visualize class performance trends. The core algorithmic component is a custom risk assessment system that analyzes grade trends over time, calculates weighted risk scores based on multiple factors (performance, engagement, assignment patterns), and detects specific at-risk behavioral patterns like consecutive grade declines or disengagement. This gives instructors explainable insights into which students need help and why, enabling data-driven intervention before students fall too far behind.

## Pharma In Review {#e5}

Daniel Robertson

![Image](images/robertson.png)

To reduce the human labor cost of performing a systematic review of pharmacological literature, I use natural language processing to analyze the text of studies and provide useful information for practitioners and researchers. Human reviewers are perferred for their expertise in the field. So, I will use ontologies, or models that represent human knowledge for computing systems, to provide a foundation for ground truth to base my computer model. This project is dedicated to developing a framework for improving upon the existing natural language processing (NLP) models for biomedical research to make them more effective. Users will be able to use the summary statistics to learn to what extent the articles they are reviewing relate to their particular field of study and what gaps their literature may reveal in their ontologies. For instance, what drugs may be emerging in clinical trials but are not categorized in the ontology yet? These and other questions would no longer require significant human resources to research using this project.

## Draw Fight {#e6}

Kit Hawkins

![Image](images/hawkins.png)

Draw Fight is a fast-paced draw-your-own fighting game, where the choices you make when drawing your fighter determine the stats that your fighter has. This game draws from the mechanics behind Jackbox games, where players use their phones as input devices by connecting to a webpage instead of mouse and keyboard or controllers. Rounds in this game are usually less than 30 seconds, allowing rapid retooling of fighter designs in order to try to gain an edge against your opponents.

## BoardClaimed {#e8}

Matthew Gwaltney

![Image](images/gwaltney.png)

My name is Matthew Gwaltney, and I am making a roguelike game inspired by boardgames using unity, the name being BoardClaimed. The goal of the game is to clear all the enemies off the board in this version of it, using events and reward spots to get stronger before fights. There are individual pools for each card, dice, and piece, along with events, combats, and enemies you can encounter. The player has a deck of cards, a set of dice to roll, and a single use piece to use when defeating board and card game themed enemies. Enemies make decisions based on the environment around them, taking in the condition of allies and the player to make choices. I used unity to make the game, visual studio to create the code, blender to make the models used, and inkscape to make the 2d artworks. Part of the project is the ability to easily add new items to each pool by putting in a new prefab into a specific folder, allowing for pools to be easily expanded in updates. My presentation of the game will take place on December 17th, at 2pm in Durland 2168, or online at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a.

## Project Manager {#e13}

Charlie Bergdall

![Image](images/bergdall.jpg)

Project Manager is a desktop application for Windows and MacOS built in Flutter, designed to help those who are always working on different projects keep track of them in one centralized location. Keeping track of endless projects with unique requirements in large cluttered spreadsheets creates many headaches. Project Manager makes this process better by tracking only the simplest data about projects, then uses a tagging system to allow projects to hold more complex project-specific data. Data pertaining to projects is stored in a Postgres database which is exposed on the internet with a FastAPI application. The database is made secure by implementing JSON Web Tokens for authentication. Project Manager also keeps track of the hours spent on a project by anyone who may be contributing to it, and uses a complex weighted ranking algorithm to suggest the ideal project to work on next. Charlie Bergdall will be presenting about Project Manager on Thursday, 12/18/25 at 9:15am in DUE 2168 (also available via zoom: https://bit.ly/cis598s24a)

Hide and seek cars is a scalable interactive demonstration for the computer science department to let people see what we can do here. Using an M5StickC Plus and some robotic cars. Using primarily python/micropython, raspberry pi, and UIflow2 a handful of cars were taught to play hide and seek in a modular environment. They have the ability to map out the board. They are also made in a way so that adding or combining new and existing rules would be easy so that the cars could learn new games in the future. 

## Fragrance Alert Application {#e16}

Chipo Sekabanja

![Image](images/sekabanja.png)

My project is called Fragrance Genie, and what it is a full-stack web application that enables users to track and manage and interact with the fragrance product data. . So oftentimes, retailers could have the lowest price for a particular fragrance in one scenario, but not in another. So one has to check out many options before finding the cheapest one. What this project does is it enables students to find the lowest across the board. In addition, because users are not always fully aware of what a product is like before buying it, the application incorporates sentiment analysis to give them a more comprehensive understanding of the fragrance they’re considering. We're using React front-end and Node.js/ Express back-end, MongoDB, sentiment analysis and website scraping.

## Kansas Population Trends Visualization {#e17}
