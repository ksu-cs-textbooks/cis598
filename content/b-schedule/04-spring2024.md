## HAL {#e1}

Abdullah Rasheed

![Image](/images/spring2024/rasheed.png)

Static program analysis aims to compute safe approximations of program properties of interest. Program analyzers are a crucial component to modern day compilers, software engineering, program verification, and much more. Unfortunately, static analyses are heavily dependent on the semantics and the syntactic structure of the programming language that is being analyzed; they also reasonably vary from property to property. This results in a vast number of analyzers for different languages, as well as analyzers for each property being analyzed. My project, “Hal,” solves these two issues through a code framework that allows users to easily specify any dataflow property for any programming language’s grammar. Hal delivers a program analyzer which can interpret the grammar and compute the specified property for any program in the given language.


## Momentum Productivity {#e2}

Luke Horsch

![Image](/images/spring2024/horsch.png)

Productivity applications are all over the app stores, but it is rare to find one that gamifies productivity and allows for social accountability in the way that I need, so I created Momentum Productivity. Momentum is an application built with Typescript, React Native, Google Firebase, and Expo for deployment on both the Apple and Google Play stores. From within the application the user can keep track and be notified of their goals, create and join challenges created by other users, and have their productivity summed up in a simple score to visualize their "Momentum" towards their goals.


## Task Management Dashboard {#e3}

Sam Boese

![Image](/images/spring2024/boese.jpg)

The Task Management Dashboard is an ASP.NET MVC focused web application meant to create an easy way to manage tasks within an organization. Once logged in, users are able to view the general details of inbound and outbound tasks. These can be edited and deleted and will be shown on a calendar GUI so that it will be harder for deadlines to creep up on you. However, if someone has still not completed their task within 24 hours of the deadline, the task manager can nudge them via an email. Finally, users can create tags to assign to different tasks which gives the ability to sort by a specific category, among other things. All in all, this dashboard seeks to provide all of the task management functionality needed in an easy, condensed manner. The presentation will be at 10:15 am on Friday, May 3 in DUE 2168 or on zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a.


## Ecifircas {#e4}

Jonah Bogusch

![Image](/images/spring2024/bogusch.png)

Ecifircas is a Chess Engine created in C++ by Jonah Bogusch. It is a console application that uses UCI protocol to communicate with Chess UIs and play chess against an opponent. The way the chess engine works is it takes in a position, generates all possible moves of the current position, then uses an AI selection algorithm to increase depth and select the best move. This project is all about computational efficiency and cool "hacks" to try and make things fast. This presentation can be attended on May 3rd at 11:00 in DUE 2168, or online at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a

![Image](/images/spring2024/pfannenstiel.png)

Beat Canvas is a sheet music editing web application developed using NextJS and ToneJS. It provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface, along with support for a wide range of instruments, that simplifies the process of creating and editing sheet music. Users can import existing sheet music in MusicXML and JSON formats, and export them to PDF, JSON, MusicXML, and MP3 files. Beat Canvas is also equipped with a comprehensive set of musical annotations that are necessary for building detailed sheet music. Additionally, Beat Canvas enhances the music creation experience with robust audio playback features, allowing users to import audio tracks to accompany their sheet music, seek to different positions in the sheet music, and loop a range of measures. These features not only allow users to fine-tune their compositions, but also provide them an effective way to practice. Beat Canvas will be presented on Friday, May 3rd, at 11:45am in room DUE 2168 and streamed live on zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a.

Nathan Lee

![Image](/images/spring2024/lee.png)

Librus is a desktop e-book management application that allows for the importing of common e-book file types (EPUB and PDF), editing of those files, and the export of those files onto an e-reader device (such as an Amazon Kindle). Librus features an ”autofill” for e-book metadata, allowing users to quickly collect information on their favorite books through the internet. In addition, Librus contains a book recommendation system so that users can look at books that may be of interest to them. Librus is written in Python, with Tkinter being the user interface library.


## Scratch Auto Grader {#e7}

Joshua Barron

![Image](/images/spring2024/barron.png)

The Kansas state legislature has recently passed a bill requiring computer science to be included in secondary schools. Many Kansas schools are underprepared for this undertaking. As such, I am developing a tool teachers can use to supplement coding feedback as a way to help them balance their ever-challenging duties. This autograder will be written in JavaScript and is intended for Scratch projects. Scratch is a block-based programming language that is a great language for introductory logic and sequential code structure. With this autograder, students can receive real-time grades as a metric of correctness, but more importantly receive feedback on where they could improve their program.


## Toy Tank Royale {#e8}

Jarrod Moore

![Image](/images/spring2024/moore.png)

Toy Tank Royale is a multiplayer computer game where players control tiny tanks that battle in a voxel-based arena that continuously transforms as the game goes on. Originally developed by a team of 3 in 2021 as a custom map for Minecraft: Java Edition, Toy Tank Royale pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible in vanilla Minecraft through its native scripting system. Pushing boundaries came at a cost, though: CPU strain. In games with 24 players or more, many low to mid-range servers struggled to keep up with the action. Join presenter Jarrod Moore on his journey to make a smoother and more performant Toy Tank Royale from the ground-up using the Unity game engine and Riptide networking library. The presentation takes place on May 3rd at 2:45pm in room DUE 2168 of the Engineering Hall and on Zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a. Those attending in-person with a personal computer will be able to take part in an interactive multi-player game demonstration. 


## Managerial Assistance Contact Console {#e10}

Max Maus

![Image](/images/spring2024/maus.png)

As any establishment increases in size, the effort needed for employees to communicate with their managers increases as well. The Managerial Assistance Contact Console (MAC C) is a system designed with the intent to ease this burden, by providing employees with an easy to use method to contact managers from anywhere in the building. A persistent SQLite database, managed by a NodeJS backend, facilitates the handling of employee requests for assistance. Both the manager and employee UIs are designed as a single-page Vue application, with an emphasis on being easy for even new employees to understand. 


## MyFlossBox {#0}

Megan Blankenship

![Image](/images/spring2024/blankenship.png)

MyFlossBox is an inventory application designed to help users manage their embroidery floss stash. This mobile web app features a barcode scanner powered by ZXing (Zebra Crossing) which streamlines the process of adding new threads to an inventory. The backend was built using ASP.NET Core and SQL Server while the frontend was created using Vue 3. I will be presenting over Zoom on May 6 at 8:45 AM CT/9:45 AM ET which will be streamed live at DUE 2168 and https://bit.ly/cis598s24a.


## Minimum Wage Matters {#2}

#### Investigating The Relationship Between Wages, Preemption Policies, Health, and Educational Outcomes

Carrie Aponte

![Image](/images/spring2024/aponte.png)

The goal of this research project is to investigate potential relationships between minimum wage, preemption policies, and various health and educational outcomes. Previous  studies have shown connections between minimum wage preemption and adverse health outcomes, but the relationships lacked thorough exploration. This presented the need to further study and quantify these relationships as well as the opportunity to investigate potential relationships with educational data. This research employed a data science approach, beginning with data collection and data wrangling, followed by thorough data exploration via supervised and unsupervised machine learning, feature selection, and correlation analysis. From these analyses, a significant relationship was established between preemption, infant mortality rates, hypertension, and numerous other poor health outcomes. A strong inverse correlation between wages and negative health outcomes was found, indicating that increased wages were associated with fewer negative health outcomes. Gender and racial relationships were discovered, showing that male and Asian students had significant links to higher wages and fewer negative health outcomes compared to female and Black students, who show significant relationships with low wages and increased adverse health outcomes. Average GPA was found to be significantly inversely correlated with a variety of poor health outcomes and positively correlated with wage increases, suggesting that academic performance increases when finances and health issues are of less concern. This study contributes to the understanding of how wages and preemption impact health and educational outcomes and highlights the importance of addressing economic disparities and health inequities to promote equitable outcomes.


## St. Isadore's Library Management System {#4}

Gabriel Whitehair

![Image](/images/spring2024/whitehair.png)

The St. Isidore’s Library Management System is geared to the small library of 600 books at St. Isidore’s Catholic Student Center. The application will allow students to create an account with an email, Google, or Microsoft Account. Students will be allowed to checkout and check back in books. It will provide them with email reminders when books are close to being due. Students will be able to search the entire catalog to see what is available. Students will be provided with recommendations based on previous reading behaviors. Some technologies used are the .NET framework, SQL, Azure, Blazor, and ISBNApi. The St. Isidore’s Library Management System is a one stop shop solution for library management at the church.


## Kansas State GPS Map {#6}

Andrew Barrett

![Image](/images/spring2024/barrett.jpg)

I have made a map of Kansas State University that when prompted will tell you the shortest path to go from one building to another. This has been done using nodes, and connecting them with neighbors, there are approximately 450 nodes that were created. The nodes store information of longitude and latitude and any other nodes it points to. I have then used an A start algorithm to find the shortest path possible. This is all in C# using Visual Studio and I have used razor pages to make a mock website.

## The Cookbook {#10}

Sebastian Trill

![Image](/images/spring2024/trill.png)

This project was born from my love to cook. Spending long hours with my family cooking dishes at holidays or just for fun. This website is for me, as well as others, to use to store their own recipes. Enough with all of the old folders with countless cutouts and loose notebook papers with recipes on them. Time to get these recipes in a more modern cookbook that allows for easy creation and searching of recipes. This site uses a built in SQLite database to make storing and searching for recipes quick and easy. Along with this, I added the benefit of auto calculating the nutrition facts for each recipe added to the website. To do this nutrition information, I utilize an API called CalorieNinjas to retrieve all of the nutrition for the recipe ingredients. With this site, it will make searching through recipes more efficient and get rid of all the clutter.


## Prowess Picks {#12}

Alex Heinking

![Image](/images/spring2024/heinking.png)

The stock market is a volatile and unpredictable part of investors' everyday life. Recently there has been traction among the idea of forecasting the future moving average of a given stock using various machine learning techniques. Prowess Picks is a web-app built to serve graphical outputs of a stock’s trained LSTM model to see this predicted moving average with a simple click. The app also contains other interesting features for investors such as ranking stocks on certain metrics, tracking the rank movement of each stock among specific metrics, and creating a profile to save desired stocks for quick access. The app is built using Angular, Flask, and Docker. 


## Procedural Surface Destruction System {#14}

Bryan Su

![Image](/images/spring2024/su.png)

Despite Rainbow Six: Siege being released years ago, there has not been many new games or projects that have the same level of destructibility as Siege's. The lack of games and projects with destruction is partly due to the lack of public resources on how to replicate this level of destruction. The goal of this project is to recreate the same procedural surface destruction system used by Siege's. The project is written in C# and implemented in the Godot Game Engine. The presentation will take place on Monday, May 6, 2024, at 2:45 PM in DUE 2168 or on Zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a. 


## RPG Squared {#16}

Garrett Love

![Image](/images/spring2024/love.png)

RPG Squared is a role-playing video game in which you play as a literal square warrior that explores the world around it and takes on enemies it encounters. As you triumph over your foes, you gain experience and level up, gaining more stats to better prepare you for the challenges ahead. The project was created using the Godot game engine for both front and back-end design. It utilizes free and custom-made assets for the art. The main goal of the project was to create game systems that I could show in a portfolio for game development positions.

## Sentiment Analysis Chatbot {#18}

Aubriana Gonzalez

![Image](/images/spring2024/gonzalez.jpg)

The Sentiment Analysis ChatBot is a chatbot designed to give sentiment results of subreddits on Reddit. It will use a keyword prompted by the user to provide subreddits and the average sentiment score of the posts within the subreddit.

## CheckMate {#23}

Chibuike Samuel Eze

![Image](/images/spring2024/eze.png)

With the recent spike in the use of AI tools such as chatbots, many can be used unethically and will inevetably be targeted towards the increase in spam with their advancement. However, currently, many AI-written emails do not get flagged for spam, with many able to bypass detection done by email filters. With many phishing emails being sent en masse from human parties, the initial hypothesis that "Emails would not be able to accurately tell the difference between human emails, scam or not, VS. AI written emails", was based on the fact that chatbots could in the future diversify phishing email syntax to prevent being flagged. CheckMate is a research project using Machine Learning Algorithms and Natural language processing (NLP) to test this hypothesis. To allow for extra preventative measures, CheckMate is also distributed as a Chrome Extension Project via Gmail, using different classifiers to make detection applicable to the everyday user.
