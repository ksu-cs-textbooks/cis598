## Ecifircas {#e4}

Jonah Bogusch

![Image](/images/spring2024/bogusch.png)

Ecifircas is a Chess Engine created in C++ by Jonah Bogusch. It is a console application that uses UCI protocol to communicate with Chess UIs and play chess against an opponent. The way the chess engine works is it takes in a position, generates all possible moves of the current position, then uses an AI selection algorithm to increase depth and select the best move. This project is all about computational efficiency and cool "hacks" to try and make things fast. This presentation can be attended on May 3rd at 11:00 in DUE 2168, or online at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a


## Beat Canvas {#e5}

Hunter Pfannenstiel & Payton Pfannenstiel

![Image](/images/spring2024/pfannenstiel.png)

Beat Canvas is a sheet music editing web application developed using NextJS and ToneJS. It provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface, along with support for a wide range of instruments, that simplifies the process of creating and editing sheet music. Users can import existing sheet music in MusicXML and JSON formats, and export them to PDF, JSON, MusicXML, and MP3 files. Beat Canvas is also equipped with a comprehensive set of musical annotations that are necessary for building detailed sheet music. Additionally, Beat Canvas enhances the music creation experience with robust audio playback features, allowing users to import audio tracks to accompany their sheet music, seek to different positions in the sheet music, and loop a range of measures. These features not only allow users to fine-tune their compositions, but also provide them an effective way to practice. Beat Canvas will be presented on Friday, May 3rd, at 11:45am in room DUE 2168 and streamed live on zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a.


## Librus {#e6}

Nathan Lee

Librus is a desktop e-book management application that allows for the importing of common e-book file types (EPUB and PDF), editing of those files, and the export of those files onto an e-reader device (such as an Amazon Kindle). Librus features an ”autofill” for e-book metadata, allowing users to quickly collect information on their favorite books through the internet. In addition, Librus contains a book recommendation system so that users can look at books that may be of interest to them. Librus is written in Python, with Tkinter being the user interface library.

## Toy Tank Royale {#e8}

Jarrod Moore

![Image](/images/spring2024/moore.png)

Toy Tank Royale is a multiplayer computer game where players control tiny tanks that battle in a voxel-based arena that continuously transforms as the game goes on. Originally developed by a team of 3 in 2021 as a custom map for Minecraft: Java Edition, Toy Tank Royale pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible in vanilla Minecraft through its native scripting system. Pushing boundaries came at a cost, though: CPU strain. In games with 24 players or more, many low to mid-range servers struggled to keep up with the action. Join presenter Jarrod Moore on his journey to make a smoother and more performant Toy Tank Royale from the ground-up using the Unity game engine and Riptide networking library. The presentation takes place on May 3rd at 2:45pm in room DUE 2168 of the Engineering Hall and on Zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a. Those attending in-person with a personal computer will be able to take part in an interactive multi-player game demonstration.

## Spotify Custom Shuffle Feature {#40}

David Bures

![Image](/images/spring2024/bures.jpg)

Spotify is a company whose business philosophy centers around cultivating each user's listening experience. Custom Shuffle is an Tag-Framework system and shuffle algorithm that allows users to have complete control over listening to their songs. The Tag-Framework system allows users to create a custom rule set based on their preferences while labeling songs with tags to determine how they should be organized. The shuffle algorithm then allows users to shuffle their playlist using their custom rules to make each listening experience completely unique. Frameworks can be build around how often the user wants the tagged songs to be played, limiting the beats per minute of the song, playing a specific artist or album at certain intervals, etc. This system give the user complete control over how the queue is organized and shuffle with little to no effort.
