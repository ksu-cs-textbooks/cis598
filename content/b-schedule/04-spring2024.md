## HAL {#e1}

Abdullah Rasheed

![Image](/images/spring2024/rasheed.png)

Static program analysis aims to compute safe approximations of program properties of interest. Program analyzers are a crucial component to modern day compilers, software engineering, program verification, and much more. Unfortunately, static analyses are heavily dependent on the semantics and the syntactic structure of the programming language that is being analyzed; they also reasonably vary from property to property. This results in a vast number of analyzers for different languages, as well as analyzers for each property being analyzed. My project, “Hal,” solves these two issues through a code framework that allows users to easily specify any dataflow property for any programming language’s grammar. Hal delivers a program analyzer which can interpret the grammar and compute the specified property for any program in the given language.


## Momentum Productivity {#e2}

Luke Horsch

![Image](/images/spring2024/horsch.png)

Productivity applications are all over the app stores, but it is rare to find one that gamifies productivity and allows for social accountability in the way that I need, so I created Momentum Productivity. Momentum is an application built with Typescript, React Native, Google Firebase, and Expo for deployment on both the Apple and Google Play stores. From within the application the user can keep track and be notified of their goals, create and join challenges created by other users, and have their productivity summed up in a simple score to visualize their "Momentum" towards their goals.


## Task Management Dashboard {#e3}

Sam Boese

![Image](/images/spring2024/boese.jpg)

The Task Management Dashboard is an ASP.NET MVC focused web application meant to create an easy way to manage tasks within an organization. Once logged in, users are able to view the general details of inbound and outbound tasks. These can be edited and deleted and will be shown on a calendar GUI so that it will be harder for deadlines to creep up on you. However, if someone has still not completed their task within 24 hours of the deadline, the task manager can nudge them via an email. Finally, users can create tags to assign to different tasks which gives the ability to sort by a specific category, among other things. All in all, this dashboard seeks to provide all of the task management functionality needed in an easy, condensed manner. The presentation will be at 10:15 am on Friday, May 3 in DUE 2168 or on zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a.


## Ecifircas {#e4}

Jonah Bogusch

![Image](/images/spring2024/bogusch.png)

Ecifircas is a Chess Engine created in C++ by Jonah Bogusch. It is a console application that uses UCI protocol to communicate with Chess UIs and play chess against an opponent. The way the chess engine works is it takes in a position, generates all possible moves of the current position, then uses an AI selection algorithm to increase depth and select the best move. This project is all about computational efficiency and cool "hacks" to try and make things fast. This presentation can be attended on May 3rd at 11:00 in DUE 2168, or online at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a

Hunter Pfannenstiel & Payton Pfannenstiel

![Image](/images/spring2024/pfannenstiel.png)

Beat Canvas is a sheet music editing web application developed using NextJS and ToneJS. It provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface, along with support for a wide range of instruments, that simplifies the process of creating and editing sheet music. Users can import existing sheet music in MusicXML and JSON formats, and export them to PDF, JSON, MusicXML, and MP3 files. Beat Canvas is also equipped with a comprehensive set of musical annotations that are necessary for building detailed sheet music. Additionally, Beat Canvas enhances the music creation experience with robust audio playback features, allowing users to import audio tracks to accompany their sheet music, seek to different positions in the sheet music, and loop a range of measures. These features not only allow users to fine-tune their compositions, but also provide them an effective way to practice. Beat Canvas will be presented on Friday, May 3rd, at 11:45am in room DUE 2168 and streamed live on zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a.


## Librus {#e6}

Nathan Lee

![Image](/images/spring2024/lee.png)

Librus is a desktop e-book management application that allows for the importing of common e-book file types (EPUB and PDF), editing of those files, and the export of those files onto an e-reader device (such as an Amazon Kindle). Librus features an ”autofill” for e-book metadata, allowing users to quickly collect information on their favorite books through the internet. In addition, Librus contains a book recommendation system so that users can look at books that may be of interest to them. Librus is written in Python, with Tkinter being the user interface library.


## Scratch Auto Grader {#e7}

Joshua Barron

![Image](/images/spring2024/barron.png)

The Kansas state legislature has recently passed a bill requiring computer science to be included in secondary schools. Many Kansas schools are underprepared for this undertaking. As such, I am developing a tool teachers can use to supplement coding feedback as a way to help them balance their ever-challenging duties. This autograder will be written in JavaScript and is intended for Scratch projects. Scratch is a block-based programming language that is a great language for introductory logic and sequential code structure. With this autograder, students can receive real-time grades as a metric of correctness, but more importantly receive feedback on where they could improve their program.


## Toy Tank Royale {#e8}

Jarrod Moore

![Image](/images/spring2024/moore.png)

Toy Tank Royale is a multiplayer computer game where players control tiny tanks that battle in a voxel-based arena that continuously transforms as the game goes on. Originally developed by a team of 3 in 2021 as a custom map for Minecraft: Java Edition, Toy Tank Royale pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible in vanilla Minecraft through its native scripting system. Pushing boundaries came at a cost, though: CPU strain. In games with 24 players or more, many low to mid-range servers struggled to keep up with the action. Join presenter Jarrod Moore on his journey to make a smoother and more performant Toy Tank Royale from the ground-up using the Unity game engine and Riptide networking library. The presentation takes place on May 3rd at 2:45pm in room DUE 2168 of the Engineering Hall and on Zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a. Those attending in-person with a personal computer will be able to take part in an interactive multi-player game demonstration. 


## Managerial Assistance Contact Console {#e10}

Max Maus

![Image](/images/spring2024/maus.png)

As any establishment increases in size, the effort needed for employees to communicate with their managers increases as well. The Managerial Assistance Contact Console (MAC C) is a system designed with the intent to ease this burden, by providing employees with an easy to use method to contact managers from anywhere in the building. A persistent SQLite database, managed by a NodeJS backend, facilitates the handling of employee requests for assistance. Both the manager and employee UIs are designed as a single-page Vue application, with an emphasis on being easy for even new employees to understand.

## Spotify Custom Shuffle Feature {#40}

David Bures

![Image](/images/spring2024/bures.jpg)

Spotify is a company whose business philosophy centers around cultivating each user's listening experience. Custom Shuffle is an Tag-Framework system and shuffle algorithm that allows users to have complete control over listening to their songs. The Tag-Framework system allows users to create a custom rule set based on their preferences while labeling songs with tags to determine how they should be organized. The shuffle algorithm then allows users to shuffle their playlist using their custom rules to make each listening experience completely unique. Frameworks can be build around how often the user wants the tagged songs to be played, limiting the beats per minute of the song, playing a specific artist or album at certain intervals, etc. This system give the user complete control over how the queue is organized and shuffle with little to no effort.

My project is a dynamic web application designed to enhance users' music knowledge and engagement by offering a unique interactive experience. Dubbed “Chop,” the website generates a personalized songs based on user preferences, challenging them to guess the artist and title of each song. Additionally, it incorporates a game-like feature inspired by the popular New York Times puzzles, where users attempt to identify five songs within a set structure. The front end of Choon is built using React, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface. On the backend, MySQL serves as the database, with Node.js facilitating server-side logic and data manipulation, while Express handles routing. This combination of technologies provides a robust platform for users to not only test their music knowledge but also save their favorite songs and track their progress over time.
