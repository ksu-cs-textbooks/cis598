KFinder is a desktop application that allows students to navigate through the Engineering Complex at Kansas State University. The program is written as a Windows Presentation Foundation within the .NET 6 Framework, it uses XAML and C#. The purpose of the program is designed so that students are able to select their current location inside any of the engineering complex locations and be given a path to their next location. The user selects their “starting” location and then their “ending” location from a drop down and then clicks the “find” button. The project uses the original .dwg floor plans from the building but altered for easier user interaction.

## Shepherd's Crossing {#2}

Zane Roberts

![Shepherd's Crossing](/images/fall2022/shepherd.png)

The Shepherd's Crossing Donor Management System integrates an existing application known as CROSS (Client Reporting and Organizational Support System), which is the internal application for the local nonprofit organization Shepherd's Crossing, with the QuickBooks API. This will serve to combine all operations of Shepherd's Crossing into a singular location while also maintaining the various useful functionalities that the QuickBooks service offers. The programming will be completed in Ruby on Rails with necessary HTML and Javascript. The final application will be presented to Shepherd's Crossing so that they can move forward with more efficient operations during their workday.

Terrestrial Things is work-in-progress 2D roguelike game where the player must fend off aliens using weapons found around a randomly generated space station. Aliens include the dog-like Shrieker and the rotating laser turret. Weapons include the nailgun, as well as a system of procedurally generated weapons with varying attributes. The weapon's scope, clip, grip, barrel, and trigger differ between each gun and affect the weapon's stats.

## Case Master {#4}

Charles "Trey" Bohlender

![Case Master](/images/fall2022/casemaster.png)

Civil and criminal attorneys have large caseloads they have to keep track of. Case Master is a CRUD case management software that is designed to help attorneys manage their large caseloads. The Case Master software allows attorneys to have quick and easy access to important information about cases stored all in one place. The Case Master software helps attorneys keep track of important information about their cases like individual contact information, deadlines, notes, and important documents. There is a shared database that can be accessed by multiple attorneys with restricted access to cases, which allows the software to work for individual attorneys and small law firms.

## Cow Reproduction App {#5}

Joshua Garcia

![Beef Reproduction](/images/fall2022/beef.png)

The Department of Animal Science from Kansas State University and Iowa State University are working together with the Beef Reproduction Task Force to create the ultimate web application to help farmers be more prepared for cattle reproduction. This web app takes in the user preferences and filters through multiple different protocols to find the best selection for the user. As time goes on, protocols will change, this web app will give the administrator the ability to update, add, or delete protocols and rules when needed.

This application offers many different features to collect and interpret the data, this process was previously done using excel. This application emphasizes ease of use and security as it will be holding personal identifiable information. This application is currently in production and being used by a cold weather shelter in Lenexa Kansas.

## Untitled Platformer {#8}

Austen Clemons

![Platformer](/images/fall2022/platformer.png)

Austen’s Untitled Platformer is a small tech demo of a 2D platforming game. The large focus of this demo is to try and emulate the smooth feel and rewarding nature of the controls seen in more famous platformers like Super Mario Brothers and Celeste. In the presentation, I will show off the game mechanics as well as give spectators a chance to try the games controls for themselves and give an opinion.

## Spool API {#9}

![Spool](/images/fall2022/spool.png)

Caleb Niehues, Ashley Rediger, Christian Berard

The Spool API is a digital toolset used to track character statistics for the Spool table-top RPG. It can programmatically resolve player-made character abilities in a session with multiple users in a Discord channel. Character abilities are represented using a programming language developed for this project.

## GPU Erasure Codes {#10}

Ben Thompson

![GPU Erasure Codes](/images/fall2022/gpuerase.png)

Erasure coding lets you protect your data by striping a file over k disks and writing coding data to an additional m disks with m<=k. This allows you to lose up to m disks and recover the whole file. This technique is commonly used, but can be rather slow, as it relies on several matrix multiplications over the Galois Field with 256 elements. I developed a GPU based implementation of a version of this technique called Reed-Solomon codes that can interface with distributed storage systems like Ceph (which the CS department at K-State uses) to try and reduce the time it takes to encode and decode data. 

## Quartz Markdown Editor {#11}

Kirkland Akins

![Quartz](/images/fall2022/quartz.png)

Quartz MD is a text editor created with the goal of making the process of writing markdown files a pleasant experience. Inspired by the popular markdown editors Typora and Obsidian, Quartz MD tries to combine simplicity with functionality. The main attraction of Quartz MD is the live preview feature, showing you what your markdown file looks like as you type it. In addition it comes with multiple features that make writing markdown faster, easier, and more enjoyable for the user.  

## OrganizED College Dashboard {#12}

Ahren Gann

![OrganizED](/images/fall2022/organized.png)

OrganizED (short for Organize Education) is a one-stop student dashboard dedicated to ensuring student success. OrganizED interacts directly with Canvas to pull down assignments, allow the student to store notes, and keep track of personal tasks. Everything is easily accessed from the main dashboard, allowing for users to manage their college career in one easy spot. By using Django and Python, OrganizED is specifically built for easy maintainability, quick response, and expansion of new features.

## Foster Friend {#13}

Katia Coleman

![Foster Friend](/images/fall2022/foster.png)

My project named Foster Friend is a website designed to assist people with fostering cats. In order to do so it provides resources, access to other fosterers, and a way to track the information collected on the cats being cared for. The tracking ability lets the users choose the information they are tracking and view the information in an easy to understand fashion.

## Gobang Game {#14}

Zhuoer Ding

![Diabetes](/images/fall2022/gobang.jpg)

This is my cis598 project for this semester, the Gobang game. Gobang has more than 4000 years history and that its rules were developed in ancient China. But we can find a similar board game with same rules, also in the findings of ancient Greece and pre-Columbian civilizations of America.  Its rules are very simple. The red and black sides take turns to play, and the first party with five consecutive pieces of their color on the board win this game. In classic gobang, people use a 20x20 board, while modern gobang is played on a 15x15 board, so I chose a 15x15 board be our game board. AI uses methods such as alpha pruning and multi-threading to improve efficiency. In addition, I have written two graphical interfaces for the game, one is the wpf version and the other is the unity version. The program contains a view and a model, all the game logic and board are encapsulated in the model, and the view is only responsible for displaying the current state of the game. Finally, I used the unit test component to test all the functions about backgammon.

## Diabetic Management Program {#15}

Steven Avila

![Diabetes](/images/fall2022/diabetes.jpg)

This program is to help people with Diabetes in keeping management of their diabetes. It allows a comprehensive form in how much insulin and carbohydrates the person have used. It also keeps track of what the blood sugar currently is and what food eaten. There is a form to look for a day you want to search for and find all information of measurements you have given that day. Last part is a calculator for how much insulin you should give yourself based on what information and a rough A1c rating on how managed the diabetes are currently.

## VCloset: A Virtual Closet {#16}

Jay Brown

![V Closet](/images/fall2022/vcloset.png)

VCloset is a C# program that solves the problem of what to wear next. Allowing the user to upload their clothing via images, one can easily create outfits virtually through the program. Just snap some images of what you already own in your closet and bring individual items together with the help of VCloset. Cycle through each article of clothing manually to assemble an outfit or use the Shuffle button to generate one. The Shuffle button will use your clothing and randomization to provide new ideas you might not have thought of previously.

## ScaleUp {#17}

Cameron Shilling

![ScaleUp](/images/fall2022/scaleup.png)

ScaleUp is a senior project by Cameron Shilling.  ScaleUp uses an industrial camera to take pictures around a small object and then converts the images to a 3D model. This model can then be printed at a larger scale to see more detail in the object. Presentation and demonstration of the project will be on Wednesday December 14th at 2:30pm in DUE 2168.

## The Book {#18}

Brayden Pankaskie

![The Book](/images/fall2022/book.jpg)

The Book is a project that combines ancient manuscripts with modern Machine Learning. Bible is a Greek word that translates to “the book” and is the most popular piece of literature ever written. It tells the story of how God made all good things, how his creation turned against Him, and his plans to make everything right again through his son, Jesus. As the Bible says, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, … Romans 3:23-24“. It contains history, poetry, and philosophy, making it an extremely interesting foundation for Machine Learning tasks. The project takes this ancient book and uses it as the context for multiple question and answering AI algorithms. Visitors may use the website interface to ask philosophical and historical questions about topics like justice, mercy, and love with the goal of gently introducing users to the Bible and Machine Learning.

## Slip NFC File Sending App {#19}

Mason Potter

![Slip](/images/fall2022/slip.png)

Digital presence is critical to success in today’s world.  Often times, exchanging social media usernames or account information comes with a huge headache.  With Slip, connecting with people has never been easier. Slip is an android mobile application that takes advantage from Near Field Communication (NFC) Technology to allow users to share social media information using just a tap.  

## MyEvents {#20}

Laura Legg

![MyEvents](/images/fall2022/myevents.png)

Clubs across K-State keep track of data vital to the health of their organization in very different ways. Several solutions have been provided, such as OrgCentral and OneDrive; however, most solutions are complicated or unorganized. MyEvents is a web application that provides K-State organizations with an effortless way to track event data. Users can schedule events, collect attendance, and view reports for each of their organizations.

## Procedurally-Generated Atari Environments {#21}

Mike Hulcy

![ProcGen](/images/fall2022/procgen.png)

Back in 2012 a team of Canadian Researchers released The Arcade Learning Environment- a python interface built on over 55 Atari 2600 games to test and benchmark reinforcement learning agents. However, these games are all trained on a preset single difficulty/mode. My idea is to adapt ALE to have procedural generation which randomizes these modes/difficulties during training, so that generalist algorithmic research can be done with this new set of environments.

## Unknown Roguelike {#22}

Haoran An

![Project Unknown](/images/fall2022/unknown.png)

This is a 2D Roguelike game. It will have a random map, random enemy, and random skill in every game to make you have met a random situation in this game. It will include 4 different weapons, and 8 different skills to help survive and close the enemy created altar. The elements from the enemy will increase your ability and give you different skills. Just like the name every step to you are unknown.

## Voxel Raytracer {#23}

Ethan Tucker

![Voxel Raytracer](/images/fall2022/voxel.png)

Ray tracing is a computer graphics algorithm that renders a 3D scene by calculating the intersection point of a ray with the scene geometry for each pixel of an image. This process allows for straightforward implementation of lighting effects including shadows, reflections, and ambient occlusion. However, the ray-scene intersections are computationally expensive. As an alternative to triangles, a scene can be represented as a grid of cubic voxels. This greatly reduces the cost of ray-intersections, allowing for a real time rendering engine. For my project I have implemented a real time voxel raytracer using the Vulkan Graphics API and C++. This engine is used in a desktop application where users can explore a detailed voxel scene with a variety of ray-traced lighting effects. The project will be presented at 10:30 on Thursday, December 15th in DUE 2168 or on Zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598f22.

## Street Signs Analytics {#24}

Rana Chevuru

![Street Signs](/images/fall2022/streets.jpg)

My name is Rana Chevuru, and I am doing street sign aggregation. Allowing artificial intelligence to detect trends can help write reports for businesses. In my case, I decided to aggregate the street signs. To do this I first had to collect the images from google maps API, and I then had to clean them before using AWS Rekognition. There were some discrepancies that came up from the training. Sounds interesting come to Durland 2168 on December 15 at 11:15.

## Wildcat Intramural {#25}

Zane Myers, Adam Winter

![IM Leagues](/images/fall2022/imleagues.png)

Wildcat Intramural Inc. is very simply a website for K-State Intramurals. We were tired of how confusing and bloated with ads IMLeagues (the current website that K-State uses for it’s intramural needs) is so we set out to create change. Our goal was to create a simple, user-friendly site that would allow students to quickly and easily create a team, join a league and invite their friends to join their team. Our aim is to help students spend less time on the paperwork and more time dreaming of winning the ultimate championship.

## Fitness App {#27}

Bhargav Marada

![Fitness App](/images/fall2022/fitness.jpg)

Hello, my name is Bhargav Marada and for my senior capstone project I decided to make a mobile fitness app. The app is based around a workout plan that I use. It is designed to give the user a structured, while still flexible workout routine with the primary goal of getting stronger. The app was designed using JS with React Native. This was my first time using React, and I would really love to share my app design and overall project with you on Thursday December 15 @ 3:15 in DUE 2168. If you are not able to attend in person you can watch my presentation with the following zoom link: https://bit.ly/cis598f22. Thank you for your time and I hope to see you there!

## Hyperbolic & Multi Horizon Learning Algorithms {#28}

Kevin Duong

![Hyperbolic Learning](/images/fall2022/hyperbolic.png)

Reinforcement Learning is an area of machine learning that uses the idea of rewards to train artificial intelligent agents. Through repeated simulations, agents can figure out their environments and learn optimal policies. Standard methods have used single-time preferrenced discounting methods for training deep neural networks, such as looking at far-distant future rewards or immediate near-term rewards. We expand this discounting scheme by implementing multi-horizon learning to include multiple time horizons during training. Current methods have been applied in Single and Multi-agent settings with promising results in the single-agent setting. Current experiments and tweaks are still being run in the multi-agent setting, however, due to possibly an implementation error. With multi-horizon learning, agents are successfully able to learn with an unbiased expectations. Results have shown in the single agent setting that this method has also provided better generalization with environments that have procedurally generated dynamics. 

## Context Textiles {#29}

Amanda Dreesen

![Contextiles](/images/fall2022/contextiles.jpg)

Only two of over 15,000 textiles artifacts housed in the K-State Textile Museum can currently be displayed. The goal of the Context Textiles capstone project is to create accessibility to these historical pieces. Context Textiles [‘conTEXTiles’] is a web application meant to display the photographed artifacts of current and past exhibits. Audience reach is supplemented through generated QR codes linked to either individual artifacts, exhibits, or the homepage. Curator, Marla Day, has made this proof-of-concept possible by supplying photographs and written information about a handful of exhibits.

## Aspiring 2D Platformer {#31}

Charles Long

[Zoom Link](https://ksu.zoom.us/j/93813802076)

![2D Platformer](/images/fall2022/2dplat.jpg)

My name is Charles Long, and My senior project is based around the Monogame and XNA frameworks, tentatively titled, “Aspiring 2D Platformer”. This platformer incorporates elements of combat, exploration, and classic inclusions such as traps and collectibles, that effect the overall game. Players are rewarded for exploring past the basic objectives, which result in reduced or increased difficulty of the game. As this was only my second experience with the Monogame framework, I am excited to share my progress with any who are interested. For those who are, please join my Friday December the 16th, at 2:00-3:00 pm on the following Zoom link: https://ksu.zoom.us/j/93813802076. Let me thank you now for taking the time participate, and any observations or suggestions you might share!
