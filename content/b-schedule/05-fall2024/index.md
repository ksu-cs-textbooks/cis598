## Proximity-Aware Spell Correction {#e9}

Dennis Meyer

![Image](images/meyer.jpg)

Proximity-Aware Spell Correction (PASC) is a C# library serving as a spell check algorithm. The driving idea for PASC is that cellphone typed phrases are riddled with misclicks and misclicks are generally adjacent or physically close to the intended target. PASC utilizes a modification of the Levenshtein Distance algorithm, where character substitutions are substantially cheaper if they are physically close to each other. This provides a spell check software that can be implemented inside other programs to suggest replacements to misclicks – as well as standard misspellings. Dennis Meyer will be presenting Proximity-Aware Spell Correction in DUE 2168 on Tuesday December 10,at 2:45 PM. The presentation will be broadcast on zoom at: bit.ly/cis598s24a

Aidan Beesley

![Image](images/beesley.png)

Maitland E. Smith Scholarship House is an off-campus living environment based on the cooperation of all its members. As a part of this, one member is hired each year to serve as the House Manager, who is responsible for the upkeep of Smith House. After serving in that role last year, I thought I could use my computer science skills to improve the efficiency of the role with my Smith House Managerial System. The SHMS is built on a Blazor web front end with a SQL and C# backend for holding and communicating data. With the SHMS, next year’s House Manager will be able to much easier track what products have been used with the data input form and usage trend graphs, as well as being able to automatically send orders for more out with an email bot. With the time saved by this system, the House Manager will be able to spend more time on the academics that got them into Smith House and just enjoy being a student on our wonderful campus. This project will be presented by myself, Aidan Beesley, on December 11th at 3:30pm in DUE 2168, or on Zoom at https://bit.ly/cis598s24a.

## Wildcat Watershed {#e23}

Logan Smith

![Image](images/smith.png)

This project is purposed to assist a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional research team in the furtherance of the knowledge and stewardship of fresh water by implementing a dashboard web application granting local residents in particular, public access to information regarding the health and status of their “backyard” watershed i.e., Wildcat Creek. The Wildcat Creek watershed is to serve as an experimental test-site at which an environmental monitoring system is to be deployed. My specific role in this is to deploy its corresponding public dashboard. This public-facing dashboard coupled with resident surveys and interviews will allow the research team to better understand the influence of enhanced native habitat visibility. The overarching aim of the group is to engage the public in the implementation of a network of “living laboratories” in various watersheds in the US Great Plains region. Due to the requirements of the research team—that the Wildcat Creek site be experimental and its dashboard public- facing—I chose to implement this application using Plotly’s Dash framework, which allows programmers to code analytic data apps and interactive dashboards. Because it can be used for almost all phases of the data analysis process it seemed to be especially well-suited for these requirements. Dash uses Flask for the backend, Plotly for producing plots, and React to handle all components. It provides HTML elements as Python classes (converting Python to HTML) in addition to providing a few other packages (Dash Core Components, Dash Bootstrap Components) that enhance its functionality while keeping the language constant.
