* **CIS 598:** CIS 560 and senior standing in computer science. Students may enroll in CIS courses only if they have earned a grade of C or better for each prerequisite to those courses.

### Course Overview

Directed studies: selection, investigation and report on some topic not covered in prior courses; may include an implementation and/or experimentation component; may be done in collaboration with other students. Completion of a final report with literature review and project evaluation.

### Course Description

In this course, students will complete a project, either individually or in small groups, under the supervision of a faculty advisor. The project will integrate concepts from prior courses, but also include a growth component including material not covered in prior courses. 

Students will create and deliver several presentations throughout the semester on the status of the project, and will also be responsible for developing design documents and other artifacts. At the end of the semester, students will present their work in a public presentation graded by the faculty advisor. 

### Major Course Topics

* Software Engineering methodologies
* Software Design Documents & Artifacts
* Public Speaking & Presentation of Technical Information
* Planning and Iterating on a Large Software Project
* Taking a Project from Idea to Completion
* Demonstrating Independent Learning & Continuing Growth in Computer Science

### Student Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, a successful student will be able to:
* Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions
* Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program's discipline
* Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts
* Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions

###  Course Structure

The course meets in person **Mondays from 3:30 - 4:20 PM in DUR 1066**. Students should attend all in-person course sessions. In-person sessions will primarily be used for student presentations throughout the semester.

On weeks where **Monday** falls on a university holiday, such as Labor Day or President's Day, the course will instead meet in person on **Wednesday** of the same week. 

Course work hours will be **Wednesdays and Fridays from 3:30 - 4:20 PM in DUR 1066 and online via Zoom**. Attendance at these work hours is optional, but highly recommended. It is a good time to work on your project, ask questions, and get advice. The instructors will be available during these times to answer questions about the class or provide project assistance.

### The Work

There is no shortcut to becoming a great programmer. Only by **doing the work** will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful computer scientist. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.

#### Deliverables

* **Project Overview & Requirements Presentation** - typically during the first and second month of the semester, each student will give a short 8-10 minute presentation introducing their chosen project, and discuss the requirements needed to complete the project. 
* **Project Design Presentation** - typically during the third and fourth month of the semester, each student will give a short 8-10 minute presentation discussing the design of their project. This should include various relevant design artifacts, such as UML diagrams, GUI mockups, API specifications, and database ER diagrams. 
* **Final Project** 
  * **Advertisement** - students will develop a single slide/image and abstract to be used for advertising their final project presentations.
  * **Presentation** - during the final weeks of the semester, students will schedule a final project presentation. That presentation will be advertised through the department and given publicly. The student's faculty advisor will grade the final project presentation.
  * **Artifacts** - at the end of the semester, students must submit the full source code of their project, presentation materials, design documents, and a short writeup detailing the project, it's completion status, and any future work to be done should another student choose to continue and build upon the project. 

### Grading

Since this is a project-based course with few deliverables, grading will be handled differently than most other college courses. Your final letter grade will reflect your overall performance in the course, including attendance, in-class presentations, public presentations, adherence to timelines, consistent progress throughout the semester, and the quality of the final project artifacts. Grading will be done in consultation between course instructors and a student's faculty advisor. 

A rough estimate of the relative grading importance of each deliverable is given below:

* 15% - Overview & Requirements Presentation
* 15% - Design Presentation
* 70% - Final Project Presentation & Artifacts

#### Specifications Grading

The two in-class presentations will be graded using _specifications grading_. Put simply, the instructors will rate how well the presentation meets the specifications given and the expectations of the instructors.Therefore, students will be given one of the following four ratings:
1. _Exceeds Expectations_
2. _Meets Expectations_
3. _Needs Revision_
4. _Incomplete_

Students who receive a _Needs Revision_ or _Incomplete_ rating will be given one chance to redo the presentation during one of the online course work hours later that week.  

#### Grade Letter Deductions

Since this is a senior-level course, points will not be given for things such as attendance and meeting deadlines, since those are expected of students at this level. However, failure to meet these expectations may result in a grade letter deduction at the end of the semester at the sole discretion of the instructors:

* Identify a project topic and faculty advisor before the deadline.
* Attend at least 80% of the in-class meeting times.
* Give a presentation on the scheduled date.
* Submit the final project advertisement by the deadline.
* Submit the final project artifacts by the deadline.

Reasonable accommodations will be made in case of unforeseen emergencies or university-excused absences. It is always best to reach out to the instructors as soon as you are aware of a situation that may require accommodation.

### Collaboration Policy

In general, students are expected to work independently on a project unless given permission from the instructors. Team projects are welcomed, but come with additional expectations to ensure that each student participates fully and the project is appropriately scoped. 

Since this is a project course, it is likely that some code in your project may come from other sources, such as a starter project or documentation. Students are expected to document each instance of code taken from another source through code comments marking the relevant location. The majority of the final project should represent the student's own work. 

### Late Work

As discussed above, students are expected to adhere to course deadlines. Failure to meet those deadlines may result in a letter grade deduction at the end of the semester.

If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to get back on track.

### Incomplete Policy

Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.

If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor's discretion. See the official [K-State Grading Policy](https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING) for more information. In general, _poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade_.

Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed [Incomplete Agreement Form](https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx), the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in this course:

1. **Students who request an incomplete will have their final grade capped at a C**.
1. Students will be given a maximum of 8 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester to complete the course. It is expected that students have completed at least half of the course in order to qualify for an incomplete. 

### Recommended Texts & Supplies

Students will make use of [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) for source code management.

Students may use their choice of IDEs and software development platforms. Many of them are available in the Computer Science Department's labs. If a particular software or framework is needed but cannot be acquired, consult with the instructors.

### Subject to Change

The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.
