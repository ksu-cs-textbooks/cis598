At the end of the semester, you'll need to submit all of your project artifacts and information for grading. Here is a helpful checklist of everything that should be submitted:

1. Initial Writeup & Feature List (_collected via Canvas early in the semester_)
1. First Presentation (_collected via Canvas when it was presented_)
1. Second Presentation (_collected via Canvas when it was presented_)
1. Advertisement Materials (_collected via Canvas before final presentation_)
1. All Code & Related Resources Pushed to GitHub Classroom Repository
   1. Repository should include a `README.md` that briefly describes how to compile/run/use the project.
   1. Repository should also include final presentation materials (slides, etc.)
1. Completed Time Log (_collected via Canvas at the end of the semester_)
1. Completed Release Information (_collected via Canvas at the end of the semester_)

Your advisor will also submit feedback on your final project presentation and artifacts. The course instructors will reach out to advisors to collect this information, so students don't have to do anything for this step.
