During the first half of the semester, each student will be scheduled to give a **Overview & Requirements Presentation** related to the project.

## Presentation Outline

The presentation should be roughly **8 minutes** in length, and cover the following topics:
* A brief overview of the project.
* A discussion of the requirements for each phase of the project.
* A proposed timeline for project completion.

The first two items roughly correspond to the two initial artifacts discussed on the previous page. The timeline should give rough estimates on when each feature or group of features should be completed. 

## Additional Content to Include

In addition to the basic outline listed above, here is a list of some other topics you may wish to cover in your presentation, especially if it is relevant to your project:

* Where the project idea came from.
* Any existing prior work or inspiration.
* What problem this project is trying to solve.
* Tools, Languages, Frameworks, or APIs to be used.
* Initial Design Diagrams (UML, ER, API, etc.)
* Initial UI mockups or Website Layout

## Sample Presentations

You can find several previous presentations under the Files section on Canvas. Bear in mind that these may or may not be example of _good_ presentations, they are simply ones that have been collected for sharing.
