## Video Topics

Below is a quick guide to the various videos and their relevance to CIS 598 projects. Feel free to use this to help you find a particular video or topic. 

* **Chapter 1**: Videos 1a and 1b talk mostly about project teams. 1a also covers work products. 1c talks about different approaches to a project, and may be helpful during initial project planning stages. 
* **Chapter 2**: Video 2b gives some useful information about software development processes. 2c is some good historical information as well. **Videos 2d and 2e are super useful** since they cover both iterative and agile development, which is the most common development process employed by students in this course. 
* **Chapter 3**: The videos from chapter 3 are useful during the early parts of the project and give lots of information about how to determine the features and requirements for a project. Watching these videos early on may help you ideate around your project.
* **Chapter 4**: Chapter 4 is mostly related to large software projects and may not be directly relevant, but is still useful in some areas. 
* **Chapter 5**: Chapter 5 covers large project management, which may be a bit outside the scope of CIS 598 but is interesting if you plan on joining or managing a large software team in the future.
* **Chapter 6**: The content in chapter 6 goes deep into project estimation, and is probably too deep for CIS 598. However, some of the content may help give you a few ideas for how to judge the approximate scope and scale of your project as you get further into planning.
* **Chapter 7**: I recommend watching some of the content in Chapter 7 on time management and evaluating progress about halfway through the semester. They can be a good prompt for reflection as you reach the halfway point and look ahead to the last part of the project.
* **Chapter 8**: Chapter 8 is mostly on value analysis, which is not really relevant to CIS 598.
* **Chapter 9**: Likewise, Chapter 9 mostly covers risk management, which is probably not relevant to most CIS 598 projects.
