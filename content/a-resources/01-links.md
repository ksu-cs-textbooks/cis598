* [System Design Textbook](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/system-design) - a great writeup on system design, starting from the basics of networking and the internet through high availability systems and case studies. This information is very useful as you get closer to having a product ready for release and deployment, but may also help inform your early design stage as well.

* [Mockola](https://mockola.com/) - IT diagramming tool developed by Keyhole Software in Lenexa, KS. The team includes a few K-State CS graduates!

* [How to Write a Good Readme](https://www.appsmith.com/blog/write-a-great-readme) - Some good tips and information about writing a GitHub README file, as well as links to some notable examples. 

* [Foursquare Data](https://location.foursquare.com/resources/blog/products/foursquare-open-source-places-a-new-foundational-dataset-for-the-geospatial-community/) - An awesome dataset of locations and POIs from Foursquare.

* [Node Vue Devcontainer](https://github.com/russfeld/node-vue-devcontainer) - A devcontainer I developed for writing web applications using Node and Vue.

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) - Another great source of datasets and information for data science projects or recommender systems

* [Example Web Project](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis526/x-examples/index.html) - A long form example project integrating Node/Express RESTful backend API with a Vue/PrimeVue frontend and a SQLite database. This makes a great shell for building web applications and is a more modern version of the Node Vue Devcontainer project linked above.
