<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/fall2022/gpuerase.png" alt="GPU Erasure Codes"></p>
<p>Erasure coding lets you protect your data by striping a file over k disks and writing coding data to an additional m disks with m&lt;=k. This allows you to lose up to m disks and recover the whole file. This technique is commonly used, but can be rather slow, as it relies on several matrix multiplications over the Galois Field with 256 elements. I developed a GPU based implementation of a version of this technique called Reed-Solomon codes that can interface with distributed storage systems like Ceph (which the CS department at K-State uses) to try and reduce the time it takes to encode and decode data.</p>

<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/fall2022/gobang.jpg" alt="Diabetes"></p>
<p>This is my cis598 project for this semester, the Gobang game. Gobang has more than 4000 years history and that its rules were developed in ancient China. But we can find a similar board game with same rules, also in the findings of ancient Greece and pre-Columbian civilizations of America.  Its rules are very simple. The red and black sides take turns to play, and the first party with five consecutive pieces of their color on the board win this game. In classic gobang, people use a 20x20 board, while modern gobang is played on a 15x15 board, so I chose a 15x15 board be our game board. AI uses methods such as alpha pruning and multi-threading to improve efficiency. In addition, I have written two graphical interfaces for the game, one is the wpf version and the other is the unity version. The program contains a view and a model, all the game logic and board are encapsulated in the model, and the view is only responsible for displaying the current state of the game. Finally, I used the unit test component to test all the functions about backgammon.</p>

<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/fall2022/book.jpg" alt="The Book"></p>
<p>The Book is a project that combines ancient manuscripts with modern Machine Learning. Bible is a Greek word that translates to “the book” and is the most popular piece of literature ever written. It tells the story of how God made all good things, how his creation turned against Him, and his plans to make everything right again through his son, Jesus. As the Bible says, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, … Romans 3:23-24“. It contains history, poetry, and philosophy, making it an extremely interesting foundation for Machine Learning tasks. The project takes this ancient book and uses it as the context for multiple question and answering AI algorithms. Visitors may use the website interface to ask philosophical and historical questions about topics like justice, mercy, and love with the goal of gently introducing users to the Bible and Machine Learning.</p>

<p>Mike Hulcy</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/fall2022/procgen.png" alt="ProcGen"></p>
<p>Back in 2012 a team of Canadian Researchers released The Arcade Learning Environment- a python interface built on over 55 Atari 2600 games to test and benchmark reinforcement learning agents. However, these games are all trained on a preset single difficulty/mode. My idea is to adapt ALE to have procedural generation which randomizes these modes/difficulties during training, so that generalist algorithmic research can be done with this new set of environments.</p>

<p>Ethan Tucker</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/fall2022/voxel.png" alt="Voxel Raytracer"></p>
<p>Ray tracing is a computer graphics algorithm that renders a 3D scene by calculating the intersection point of a ray with the scene geometry for each pixel of an image. This process allows for straightforward implementation of lighting effects including shadows, reflections, and ambient occlusion. However, the ray-scene intersections are computationally expensive. As an alternative to triangles, a scene can be represented as a grid of cubic voxels. This greatly reduces the cost of ray-intersections, allowing for a real time rendering engine. For my project I have implemented a real time voxel raytracer using the Vulkan Graphics API and C++. This engine is used in a desktop application where users can explore a detailed voxel scene with a variety of ray-traced lighting effects. The project will be presented at 10:30 on Thursday, December 15th in DUE 2168 or on Zoom at

<p>My name is Rana Chevuru, and I am doing street sign aggregation. Allowing artificial intelligence to detect trends can help write reports for businesses. In my case, I decided to aggregate the street signs. To do this I first had to collect the images from google maps API, and I then had to clean them before using AWS Rekognition. There were some discrepancies that came up from the training. Sounds interesting come to Durland 2168 on December 15 at 11:15.</p>

<p>Wildcat Intramural Inc. is very simply a website for K-State Intramurals. We were tired of how confusing and bloated with ads IMLeagues (the current website that K-State uses for it’s intramural needs) is so we set out to create change. Our goal was to create a simple, user-friendly site that would allow students to quickly and easily create a team, join a league and invite their friends to join their team. Our aim is to help students spend less time on the paperwork and more time dreaming of winning the ultimate championship.</p>

<p>Kevin Duong</p>
<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/fall2022/hyperbolic.png" alt="Hyperbolic Learning"></p>
<p>Reinforcement Learning is an area of machine learning that uses the idea of rewards to train artificial intelligent agents. Through repeated simulations, agents can figure out their environments and learn optimal policies. Standard methods have used single-time preferrenced discounting methods for training deep neural networks, such as looking at far-distant future rewards or immediate near-term rewards. We expand this discounting scheme by implementing multi-horizon learning to include multiple time horizons during training. Current methods have been applied in Single and Multi-agent settings with promising results in the single-agent setting. Current experiments and tweaks are still being run in the multi-agent setting, however, due to possibly an implementation error. With multi-horizon learning, agents are successfully able to learn with an unbiased expectations. Results have shown in the single agent setting that this method has also provided better generalization with environments that have procedurally generated dynamics.</p>

<p>Data Processing Units (DPU) are a cutting edge technology developed by NVIDIA in the efforts
of offloading computation that could be done by the processor. Our team has been working to
recreate the experiment “GraphBLAS on the Edge: Anonymized High Performance Streaming of
Network Traffic”. The idea being that instead of using high thread count central processing units
(CPU) a DPU could be used to either create similar results or even increase performance. The
implementation of this project was achieved with libraries such as Data Plane Development Kit
(DPDK) and GraphBLAS and written in C.</p>

<p>Cashel FitzGibbons’s Computer Science Project, a Hydroponic Management System, will be presented at 8 a.m. on Tuesday, May 9th, 2023. The presentation will be held in DUE 2168 and streamed on Zoom at 

<a href="https://bit.ly/cis598s23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/cis598s23</a>. Hydroponics is a horticultural practice that allows for growing plants without soil by submerging the roots in a nutrient rich aqueous solution. The benefits of this include more control over the plants’ development, greater planting-density via verticality, and no dependence on soil quality. This project presents an easily expandable technological solution that can manage the overhead of monitoring and regulating the environment of a hydroponic system and allow the grower to easily access and control the system via a website. The development stack for such a system must include sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, small single-board computers, a database management server, a web server, and a corresponding user-friendly website. The Hydroponic Management System proposed in this project will utilize Arduino Nanos, to control relevant sensors and actuators, that connects via Bluetooth to a Raspberry Pi, to allow future controllers to be easily added, which inserts the data into a MSSQL Server database bound to a website developed using ASP.NET Razor and MVVM architecture hosted on a ASP.NET webserver. The MSSQL Server and Webserver are hosted locally via Docker.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;3D Printing Monitoring Framework&rdquo; is a Python-based software framework that automatically monitors 3D printing processes using webcam images. The program uses computer vision techniques to analyze the images and detect issues such as print detachment or lack of extrusion. The framework is currently configured to use a Prusa I3 Mk3 printer and pre-sliced gcode. To use the framework, the user is prompted to connect the webcam and printer through serial communication, load in a gcode file, and press start. From there, the program runs autonomously until the part is printed, at which point the program logs the results. The program is designed to run locally on a user&rsquo;s computer and is relatively lightweight. The program is designed as a framework, meant to be expanded in the future, introducing new features, and adding broader support for printers and webcams.</p>

<p>Ways to control things that happen within video games have been the same for a while, in my opinion. Magical Casters is a game that looks to fix that, by using a Neural Network (Keras/TensorFlow) to observe mouse movements in the form of a drawing and classify it. In a randomly generated 2D Voxel-based world built in Monogame and filled with fearsome foes and life-changing loot, having a certain stick and drawing magical circles allows even the most average caster to create magnificent fireballs or whatever they may please, with respect to what they have learned. The foes you may encounter can be the harmless-looking slime or the large and slow but powerful golem. Hidden among these enemies, however, you will find bountiful rewards for whoever is brave enough to take the journey.</p>

<p>The Maitland E. Smith Scholarship House is an off-campus cooperative living option for all K-State male students. The house was established back in 1958 and currently consists of 34 members. Over the years, it’s apparent that the house is failing to keep up with the fast pace of the technological advancements the world is going through nowadays, and one of the root problems is our outdated website. Web of Smithies is an upgraded website built with React JS on the front-end and Cypher on the back end. It is a collection of microservices and is designed to help with three main aspects of the house: informativity, connectivity, and creativity. With this tool, people who aren’t familiar with the house can be informed, the recruiting process will become much easier, and current smithies (house members) will have the opportunity to connect with each other, incoming new-men, and alumnus better. Overall, Web of Smithies will increase the life quality of everyone associated with Smith House and help show the world just how exciting cooperative living can be.</p>

<p>Golf tournaments are extremely hard to predict as there are 156 players in one tournament and any of them have a chance to win. The Golf Tournament Prediction Model will be able to output six potential players that have a good chance of winning based off how the player’s strengths and the course’s strengths align. Many courses are tailored better to some players’ game as each individual course has certain aspects that differ from other courses. The model uses machine learning software Weka to help create a working algorithm. Come support Mason Wittman on Wednesday May 10, 2023, at 8:45AM – 9:30AM in DUE 2168 or at

<p>The Worlds Without Number Faction Simulator is an application developed by Evelyn Gruver. Worlds Without Number, its namesake, is a tabletop RPG written by Kevin Crawford. An optional game mechanic is a faction simulator designed to generate events that occur in the world of the campaign a Game Master (GM) is running. This faction simulator from the game rules is a strategy game that the GM runs entirely themselves before engaging with players to dynamically alter the world around them. The simulator is an incredibly useful tool; however, it can be cumbersome to use for large factions with many assets. The Worlds Without Number Faction Simulator aims to remedy this issue with WPF, SSMS, and C# by running the process for the GM as an application so the GM doesn’t have to make the dice rolls themselves. The presentation is Wednesday, May 10 at 9:30 in DUE 2168, or can be viewed on Zoom here:

<p>Trying to understand the geopolitics among the different nations is quite challenging. We need serval different tools to understand this topic. Therefore, a tool can be showing that trade between nations can be exponential in understanding geopolitics. A way to show trade between nations is by creating a browser dashboard through Flask and Plotly, properly named interactions between nations through trade. The presentation will be held on May 10 at 10;15 am in Durland 2168.</p>

<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/spring2023/mcanany.png" alt="Realistic Biome Generator"></p>
<p>Realistic Biome Generator is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5. The plugin generates natural and multi-biome terrain using C++ and the libraries FastNoiseLite and RealtimeMeshComponent. The process involves creating the initial terrain using noise, calculating the different climates of the landscape, and then determining the biomes based on calculated annual precipitation and average temperature. Once the biomes have been computed, it will automatically create the terrain mesh and apply the specified ground materials for each biome type. This project will enable users to rapidly produce more immersive game environments and bring greater realism to their games. This project will be presented by Sam McAnany at 1:15 - 2:00 PM on Wednesday, May 10, 2023, in DUE 2168 or on Zoom at

<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/spring2023/honas.png" alt="ViShader"></p>
<p>ViShader is a graph-based editor for visually creating HLSL shaders. In contrast to similar graph-based shader editors like Unity’s Shader Graph, ViShader is not tied to a game engine but rather operates as a standalone application. Additionally, ViShader produces 2D fragment shaders making it suitable for game frameworks like MonoGame where no graph-based shader editors currently exist. ViShader was developed using C#, Windows Presentation Foundation, .NET 6.0, the MVVM Toolkit, and the open-source library Nodify. Eric Honas will be presenting ViShader at 2:00pm - 2:45pm on Wednesday, May 10, in DUE 2168. The presentation will also be available on Zoom using the link

<p>Dou dizhu is an online web multiplayer card game, which is a popular poker game in China. Using React and CSS to build the client and setup a Node.js server with Express framework. Configuring Socket.io on the server and client-side to relay gameplay. The game is played by three players with a deck of 54 cards. One of the player is the landlord and the other two are farmers. The two sides fight, and the one who finishes the cards first wins. The core gameplay mechanic revolves around comparing card categories. In general, players can only outdo the previously played card category if they possess a card or set of cards of the same category and length, but with a higher rank. If no other player can beat the current category, the player who played the unbeatable category is allowed to choose a new category to continue the game.</p>

<p>Mushroom cultivation is growing, both as a hobby and a small business opportunity. Grain spawn is a nutrient-dense food source fully colonized and free from contamination. It is used to inoculate a larger substrate, like straw or sawdust, giving the desired fungus a head start against any competing decomposers. Because producing it can be slow and tedious, it is often expensive. I designed a device that makes grain spawn production easier and quicker. The project runs on a raspberry pi zero SBC. The sensor and control code is written in rust. Data is logged in a SQLite database. Freecad was used to model all mechanical parts, and python was used to automate part of that process. Data will accessable by exporting a csv of log files.</p>

<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/spring2023/gabrielson.png" alt="What&amp;rsquo;s Next"></p>
<p>What’s Next is a web application designed to aid users in finding new music to listen to, as well as play on guitar. The application was built using a Django backend and a React frontend. There are three main pieces of functionality used in the application: a dashboard showing basic statistics about the current logged in user’s Spotify listening habits, a page to find new music to listen to, and a page for a user to find music to play on guitar. The application uses data from the Spotify API for user statistics, as well as to obtain the audio features of songs - the basis of the recommendation system. In addition to this, the application uses web scraped tablature from guitar tab websites to recommend songs to recommend songs that a user will both want to learn, and can reasonably learn.</p>

<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/spring2023/friesen.jpg" alt="Legion DB"></p>
<p>With the advent of modern data systems for web development, SQL server is being complemented by many NoSQL solutions which are better suited for web APIs like REST and SOAP. While there are many database applications for NoSQL and big data, many companies still struggle finding a way to store and operate with data from 3rd party API’s. Legion DB is a database engine designed to store both JSON and XML, the two most popular API return types. This would allow companies to easily store data for future use in the format it originally was produced in with very little effort. The engine has many performance features to improve query performance over simply storing raw files and adds important meta information automatically to assist developers in creating useful data platform features.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Adam Clement and my senior project is titled Analyses of Institutional Reputation through Social Media Data. My project consisted of collecting and analyzing data related to Kansas State University from three social media; Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. With my analysis I hope to provide the Office of Institutional Research and Assessment valuable data so they can perform better marketing and recruiting strategies. Included in my analysis, I also looked at social media data from our Big 12 competitors to see how our social media prescence stacked up against our peers. I used four main types of analysis in my research; sentiment, topic, engagement, and competitive analysis. If you would like to see what my research found, you can attend my presentation on Thursday, May 11th at 10:15am in DUE 2168 or via Zoom at the following link

<p>The Personal Financial Planning Assistant is a project focused on offering the storage of financial information and using that information to calculate common personal finance equations. Towards this the application is run in the Visual studio IDE utilizing the Windows forms application preset and Microsoft’s EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite. Using these tools the application Gui allows the user to add all financial transactions into a local database file sorted into different types of revenue and income. Using these Records the user can calculate personal financial planning equations with little input and display the results in visual forms. This allows the user to have a better visual understanding of their financial desires and situation.</p>

<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/spring2023/capps.png" alt="ELA Platform"></p>
<p>An ELA is an equivalent learning activity. Activities are equivalent if they teach the same concept and provide a similar level of scaffolding/support to the student. ELAs can enable teachers to adhere to a concept called Mastery Learning, which is a method of curriculum delivery shown to be effective, but not present in many classrooms. ELAs can also enable the Universal Design for Learning (UDL), another set of researched concepts involving optimal circumstances for learners. The ELA Platform is a webapp which integrates existing ELAs with an LMS via the IMS LTI standard. By fusing these standardized learning technologies and concepts (Mastery, Equivalency, UDL, LTI, LMS), the ELA Platform can improve learning strategies across many classrooms.</p>

<p><img src="https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/images/spring2023/akins.png" alt="Spells and Shapes"></p>
<p>Spells and Shapes is a minimalistic 2D rouge like game that was created using the Godot Engine. In the game the player progresses through a series of procedurally generated encounters using a repertoire of player made magic spells to combat enemies that stand in their way. Completing encounters rewards the player with “Spell Components”, which are used to create and modify what spells they have available to them. Both the player and the enemies they face get access to more and stronger Spell Components as the game progresses, allowing the spells they use to become more varied and numerous. The modular design and random acquisition of Spell Components ensures that each attempt is different than the last, and forces players to adapt what spells they use as they progress.</p>

<p>My name is Reece Miller, and my presentation will provide an in-depth overview of my Active Directory Discord Bot. Over the last few years, the online VoIP and social platform Discord has proven to be a versatile tool in both education and in the workplace. Within a Discord server, administrator privileges and permissions are organized with a hierarchical “role” system; users can be given roles on the server that grant them elevated permissions which dictate what they can and cannot see. The Active Directory Discord Bot uses the Discord.js library and the Gmail API to sync these roles with the groups that a user belongs to within a Windows Active Directory through a simple email verification process. To become “AD Verified” and access previously locked elements of the Discord server, a user must provide their email address and then verify their identity with a v4 UUID that is sent to that address. My presentation will take place on Thursday, May 11th from 2:30-3:15 in DUE 2168. A link to the Zoom stream can be found at
