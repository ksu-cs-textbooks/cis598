<p>The major outcome for this course is a project that demonstrates your skills in computer science, software development, and other areas relevant to your chosen degree program. This page provides an overview that will help you get started on your project.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-timeline">Recommended Timeline</h2>
<p>Here is a recommended timeline for your project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: Identify a project, get a project advisor.</li>
<li>Week 2: Report your project topic and advisor. Start developing.</li>
<li>Week 3: &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; Complete.</li>
<li>Weeks 3-8: Overview &amp; Requirements Presentations &amp; First Round of Development.</li>
<li>Week 8: <strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Complete.</strong></li>
<li>Weeks 9-14: Design Presentations &amp; Second Round of Development.</li>
<li>Week 14: Schedule Final Presentation &amp; Create Promotional Materials</li>
<li>Week 15: <strong>Version 1.0 Feature Complete.</strong></li>
<li>Weeks 15-16: Final Presentations.</li>
<li>Week 16: Submit Final Materials.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choosing-a-topic">Choosing a Topic</h2>
<p>The first major step is to identify a possible topic for your project. It should align with your interests in the field, and it may also fit well with previous courses you&rsquo;ve taken or possibly future career paths. You may also choose to use your project to explore a new topic or framework that you&rsquo;d like to get experience with.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to choose to try and duplicate an existing program from scratch, putting your own spin on it and writing the code from scratch. For example, you may choose to try and duplicate the underlying code and features for a popular social network - in effect your project is driven by their design, but you have to figure out how to build it and code it yourself.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are having trouble finding a topic, consult the <strong>Project Ideas</strong> folder on Canvas for project ideas that have been submitted or previous projects that could be continued. You can also chat with the course instructors to get some ideas of a project to consider, or if you have an advisor you&rsquo;d like to work with, chat with them for some ideas.</p>
<h2 id="finding-an-advisor">Finding an Advisor</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve identified a project, you&rsquo;ll need to select a faculty advisor to work with. Throughout the semester, you&rsquo;ll meet regularly to discuss your project with your faculty advisor, and follow their guidance to produce a quality product.</p>
<p>Typically you want to choose a faculty advisor that is familiar with your project area, since they will be most likely to be able to provide good assistance and feedback as you work on your project.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure which faculty members may fit well with your project idea, contact the course instructors or consult the information on the <a href="https://cs.ksu.edu/about/people/faculty/" target="_blank">CS Faculty</a> webpage.</p>

<div class="notices note" ><p>Note</p><h2 id="advisor-responsibilities">Advisor Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Each advisor approaches senior projects differently, but in general your advisor will typically ask you to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide an overview of the project and a list of features to be developed.</li>
<li>Meet weekly to provide status updates on the project.</li>
<li>Read or review additional information, research papers, etc. related to your project.</li>
<li>Share your code and other project artifacts for review</li>
<li>Schedule a final project presentation</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="initial-artifacts">Initial Artifacts</h2>
<p>At the very beginning of your project, you should create a few initial artifacts to start the development process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writeup:</strong> prepare a short, 1 page writeup that describes your project topic. It should give some basic use-cases and a rough idea of the architecture or platforms you plan on using in the project.</li>
<li><strong>Feature Lists:</strong> prepare three sets of feature lists for your project:
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong> or <em>must haves</em>: these are features that must be present in the project for it to function in the basic sense. It usually doesn&rsquo;t include much in the way of user interface beyond the basic interactions, and it may be missing some additional items to make it more useable. A project that has these features could be considered a Minimum Viable Product. Typically you want to have these features completed in the first 8 weeks of development.</li>
<li><strong>Version 1.0</strong> or <em>should haves</em>: these are features that should be present in the project for it to be considered complete. This would involve additional usability features or links to other APIs as needed. A project with these features would be considered a 1.0 product, and could be used by others. Typically these features are completed in the second 8 weeks of development.</li>
<li><strong>Version 2.0</strong> or <em>would like to haves</em>: these are cool features that would be useful to have in a finalized project, but they may be outside the scope of what is achievable in a single semester. The lack of these features should not impact the useability or functionality of the project. Typically these features are simply listed on the &ldquo;Future Work&rdquo; portion of the final presentation, but if you complete the project ahead of schedule you may consider adding one or more of these features to the project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These artifacts are not &ldquo;set in stone&rdquo; and can be easily adjusted throughout the project. For example, you may find that a feature previously on the Version 2.0 list is not critical, and it moves to an earlier list.</p>
<h2 id="ongoing-artifacts">Ongoing Artifacts</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve found your project topic and started working, there are a few artifacts that you&rsquo;ll need to keep track of throughout the semester, while continually updating them each week or so:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Log:</strong> Each week, record the number of hours spent working on the project, and a brief paragraph detailing the status of the project and major accomplishments for the week.</li>
<li><strong>Code Repository:</strong> You should be committing regularly to a code repository on GitHub Classroom. At the very least, you should make a commit each day that you work on the project. The repository will be used to confirm that you are consistently making progress on your project.</li>
<li><strong>Design Diagrams:</strong> For each of the presentations, you&rsquo;ll need to have a set of updated diagrams for your project. This could include UML class diagrams, database entity relationship diagram, API diagrams, GUI mockups, and more. You should strive to keep these documents updated as you work on the project.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hello-world">Hello World</h2>
<p>The next step in creating a successful project is getting to the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; stage. This typically involves configuring your development environment, creating a new project or downloading an existing project, and confirming that you can successfully build and run the project in its simplest form. Ideally, you should be at the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; stage of your project <strong>no later than week 3</strong>, and ideally much sooner. This is especially important if you are learning how to use a new framework, programming language, or tool, as it may require significant work to get to this stage alone.</p>
<p>Once you are at the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; stage, you are at the point where you can start adding features to your project from the feature lists described above. A great way to think of those feature lists is like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29#Product_backlog" target="_blank">Product Backlog</a> in the agile software methodology - it is a list of project requirements to be completed.</p>

<div class="notices tip" ><p>Tip</p><h2 id="project-scale-and-scope">Project Scale and Scope</h2>
<p>One area that many students struggle with is finding a project that has the appropriate scale and scope for a senior project. While there are no clear rules for this, and each student&rsquo;s situation is different, here are some suggestions for finding an appropriately sized project.</p>
<ul>
<li>The course is 3 credit hours, which roughly equates to an expectation of 9 hours of work each week. Across a 16 week semester, that comes to a total of 144 hours, or just over three and a half 40 hour work weeks if you worked on it full time. You&rsquo;ll be tracking your hours worked throughout the semester, and that may help you make sure you are spending enough time on your project.</li>
<li>If you are working in a new framework or language, you should work completely through the initial tutorial in the first couple of weeks of class. Your finished project must go significantly beyond what is covered in the tutorial.</li>
<li>Typically projects will have 3-4 major features that make up the minimum viable product, and another 3-4 major features for version 1.0. Each feature should require 1-2 weeks of effort to implement.</li>
<li>Your advisor and course instructors can help you determine if your proposed project has appropriate scope, or if it needs modification. You should consult with them early on in the process, and continually update them on your progress, especially if your planned features change.</li>
</ul>
