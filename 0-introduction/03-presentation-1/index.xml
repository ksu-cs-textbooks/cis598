Presentation Outline The presentation should be roughly 8 minutes in length, and cover the following topics:
A brief overview of the project. NEW A small set (2-3) of top level use cases for the project. These use cases should clearly lead to the requirements in the next bullet point. These use cases will inform the testing plan in the next presentation. A discussion of the requirements for each phase of the project. These requirements will inform the overall design of the project in the next presentation. A proposed timeline for project completion. The first three items roughly correspond to the two initial artifacts discussed on the previous page. The timeline should give rough estimates on when each feature or group of features should be completed.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis598/0-introduction/03-presentation-1/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
