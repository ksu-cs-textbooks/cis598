Meet with your project advisor, either in person or via Zoom, to provide them with a clear update on your project. Ideally, you should be showing them code or working prototypes, not just a quick verbal update. They are here to provide help but need to know exactly what is going on in your project. Discuss issues, questions, and next steps with your advisor during the meeting. Record the time worked on the project and tasks completed in Clockify. You should record your time at least weekly, but we encourage you to record time on a daily basis. Update the task board for your project in GitHub. Commit your current code to the GitHub Classroom repository for your project. You may also use a secondary repository if you would like, but your code must be accessible in the GitHub Classroom repository unless other arrangements have been made (i.e. you are working on a project for a company and storing the code in their systems). Fill out the biweekly survey before the due date.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis598/0-introduction/02-weekly-work/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
