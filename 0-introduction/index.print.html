Students may enroll in CIS courses only if they have earned a grade of C or better for each prerequisite to those courses.</li></ul><h3 id=course-overview>Course Overview</h3><p>Directed studies: selection, investigation and report on some topic not covered in prior courses; may include an implementation and/or experimentation component; may be done in collaboration with other students. Completion of a final report with literature review and project evaluation.</p><h3 id=course-description>Course Description</h3><p>In this course, students will complete a project, either individually or in small groups, under the supervision of a faculty advisor. The project will integrate concepts from prior courses, but also include a growth component including material not covered in prior courses.</p><p>Students will create and deliver several presentations throughout the semester on the status of the project, and will also be responsible for developing design documents and other artifacts. At the end of the semester, students will present their work in a public presentation graded by the faculty advisor.</p><h3 id=major-course-topics>Major Course Topics</h3><ul><li>Software Engineering methodologies</li><li>Software Design Documents & Artifacts</li><li>Public Speaking & Presentation of Technical Information</li><li>Planning and Iterating on a Large Software Project</li><li>Taking a Project from Idea to Completion</li><li>Demonstrating Independent Learning & Continuing Growth in Computer Science</li></ul><h3 id=student-learning-outcomes>Student Learning Outcomes</h3><p>After completing this course, a successful student will be able to:</p><ul><li>Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions</li><li>Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program&rsquo;s discipline</li><li>Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts</li><li>Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions</li></ul><h3 id=course-structure>Course Structure</h3><p>The course meets in person <strong>Tuesdays from 2:30 - 3:45 PM in BT 114</strong>. Students should attend all in-person course sessions to which they are assigned. In-person sessions will primarily be used for student presentations throughout the semester. There may also be one or two <strong>Thursday</strong> in-person class periods for presentations. These dates will be clearly announced in advance.</p><p>On weeks where <strong>Tuesday</strong> falls on a university holiday, the course will instead meet in person on <strong>Thursday</strong> of the same week.</p><p>Course work hours will be <strong>Thursdays from 2:30 - 3:45 PM online via Zoom</strong>. Attendance at these work hours is optional, but highly recommended. It is a good time to work on your project, ask questions, and get advice. The instructors will be available during these times to answer questions about the class or provide project assistance.</p><h3 id=the-work>The Work</h3><p>There is no shortcut to becoming a great programmer. Only by <strong>doing the work</strong> will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful computer scientist. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.</p><h4 id=deliverables>Deliverables</h4><ul><li><strong>Initial Writeup & Feature List</strong> - typically early in the semester, students will submit an initial writeup detailing their project, identifying a faculty advisor, and listing the features for their project.</li><li><strong>Project Overview & Requirements Presentation</strong> - typically during the first and second month of the semester, each student will give a short 8-10 minute presentation introducing their chosen project, and discuss the requirements needed to complete the project.</li><li><strong>Project Design Presentation</strong> - typically during the third and fourth month of the semester, each student will give a short 8-10 minute presentation discussing the design of their project. This should include various relevant design artifacts, such as UML diagrams, GUI mockups, API specifications, and database ER diagrams.</li><li><strong>Final Project</strong><ul><li><strong>Advertisement</strong> - students will develop a single slide/image and abstract to be used for advertising their final project presentations.</li><li><strong>Presentation</strong> - during the final weeks of the semester, students will schedule a final project presentation. That presentation will be advertised through the department and given publicly. The student&rsquo;s faculty advisor will grade the final project presentation.</li><li><strong>Artifacts</strong> - at the end of the semester, students must submit the full source code of their project, presentation materials, design documents, and a short writeup detailing the project, it&rsquo;s completion status, and any future work to be done should another student choose to continue and build upon the project.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=grading>Grading</h3><p>Since this is a project-based course with few deliverables, grading will be handled differently than most other college courses. Your final letter grade will reflect your overall performance in the course, including attendance, in-class presentations, public presentations, adherence to timelines, consistent progress throughout the semester, and the quality of the final project artifacts. Grading will be done in consultation between course instructors and a student&rsquo;s faculty advisor.</p><p>A rough estimate of the relative grading importance of each deliverable is given below:</p><ul><li>30% - Completion of Initial Artifacts and Presentations; In-Class Attendance and Adherence to Deadlines</li><li>70% - Final Project Presentation & Artifacts</li></ul><h4 id=specifications-grading>Specifications Grading</h4><p>The two in-class presentations will be graded using <em>specifications grading</em>. Put simply, the instructors will rate how well the presentation meets the specifications given and the expectations of the instructors.Therefore, students will be given one of the following four ratings:</p><ol><li><em>Exceeds Expectations</em></li><li><em>Meets Expectations</em></li><li><em>Needs Revision</em></li><li><em>Incomplete</em></li></ol><p>Students who receive a <em>Needs Revision</em> or <em>Incomplete</em> rating will be given one chance to redo the presentation during one of the online course work hours later that week.</p><h4 id=grade-letter-deductions>Grade Letter Deductions</h4><p>Since this is a senior-level course, points will not be given for things such as attendance and meeting deadlines, since those are expected of students at this level. However, failure to meet these expectations may result in a grade letter deduction at the end of the semester at the sole discretion of the instructors:</p><ul><li>Identify a project topic and faculty advisor before the deadline.</li><li>Attend at least 80% of the in-class meeting times.</li><li>Give a presentation on the scheduled date.</li><li>Submit the final project advertisement by the deadline.</li><li>Submit the final project artifacts by the deadline.</li></ul><p>Reasonable accommodations will be made in case of unforeseen emergencies or university-excused absences. It is always best to reach out to the instructors as soon as you are aware of a situation that may require accommodation.</p><h3 id=collaboration-policy>Collaboration Policy</h3><p>In general, students are expected to work independently on a project unless given permission from the instructors. Team projects are welcomed, but come with additional expectations to ensure that each student participates fully and the project is appropriately scoped.</p><p>Since this is a project course, it is likely that some code in your project may come from other sources, such as a starter project or documentation. Students are expected to document each instance of code taken from another source through code comments marking the relevant location. The majority of the final project should represent the student&rsquo;s own work.</p><h3 id=artificial-intelligence-usage-policy>Artificial Intelligence Usage Policy</h3><p>This course uses a stoplight approach regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and others. Each assignment or group of assignments will be clearly labelled with one of three labels, indicating what level of GenAI usage is allowed.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices default" style=--VARIABLE-BOX-color:red><summary class="box-label a11y-only" tabindex=-1><span class=a11y-only>Details</span></summary><div class=box-content><div style=display:block><div style=float:left;padding-right:10px><img src=/cis598/images/0/stoplight_red.png height=120px></div><div><span class="badge cstyle red"><span class=badge-content>RED: GenAI Prohibited</span></span> You may not use any GenAI tools to complete this assignment.

Citations should include the tool used, the prompt(s) given, context provided to the tool (e.g. existing code), and a discussion of how the results were used to complete the assignment.</p><p><strong>No Direct AI Results:</strong> For this assignment, you <strong>may not</strong> include the GenAI results directly in your submission - it must be used to inform and adapted to fit your own work. For example, you may not prompt GenAI tools to just <em>write</em> your code and submit that directly; instead, you should ask for help performing specific tasks and then use the results within your own work.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Work:</strong> To ensure compliance with this policy, the instructor reserves the right to request additional discussion or explanation of any work submitted by a student. The student should understand and be able to clearly explain <strong>all</strong> submitted work and code, even materials directly or indirectly produced by GenAI. A student who is unable to explain a submission to the satisfaction of the instructor may be considered to be in violation of this policy.</p><p><strong>Policy Violations:</strong> Any usage of GenAI that involves direct submission of the GenAI outputs without additional work done by the student, or use of GenAI without proper citation, may be treated as a violation of the K-State Honor Pledge and may result in a grade of 0 for the assignment and other sanctions approved through the K-State Honor Council.</p></div></details><details open class="box cstyle notices default" style=--VARIABLE-BOX-color:green><summary class="box-label a11y-only" tabindex=-1><span class=a11y-only>Details</span></summary><div class=box-content><div style=display:block><div style=float:left;padding-right:10px><img src=/cis598/images/0/stoplight_green.png height=120px></div><div><span class="badge cstyle green"><span class=badge-content>GREEN: GenAI Encouraged</span></span> You may make unlimited use of GenAI tools to complete this assignment.

It is your responsibility to understand it and proactively ask questions if you are unsure; ignorance of this policy is not an excuse for violating it.</p><h3 id=artificial-intelligence-disclosure>Artificial Intelligence Disclosure</h3><p>In keeping with the expectation for transparency and citation regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the instructors of this course will clearly denote any usage of GenAI tools in the process of teaching this class. Specific policies for the usage of GenAI by the instructors and TAs of this course are given below:</p><ul><li><span class="badge cstyle red"><span class=badge-content>RED: GenAI Prohibited</span></span> <strong>Grading and Feedback</strong> - GenAI will <strong>never</strong> be used to review student submissions or produce grading feedback. All grades and feedback will be provided by the instructors and TAs without any GenAI assistance.</li><li><span class="badge cstyle red"><span class=badge-content>RED: GenAI Prohibited</span></span> <strong>Student Communication</strong> - GenAI will <strong>never</strong> be used to when communicating with students. We believe it is important for students to receive real, authentic communication from instructors and TAs</li><li><span class="badge cstyle orange"><span class=badge-content>YELLOW: Limited GenAI Usage Allowed</span></span> <strong>Lesson & Learning Content</strong> - GenAI may be used in a limited way to construct lessons and learning content, such as homework scenarios or simple graphics. All usage of GenAI will be clearly marked and cited. (As of January 2026, no GenAI content exists in the course).</li></ul><h3 id=late-work>Late Work</h3><p>As discussed above, students are expected to adhere to course deadlines. Failure to meet those deadlines may result in a letter grade deduction at the end of the semester.</p><p>If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to get back on track.</p><h3 id=incomplete-policy>Incomplete Policy</h3><p>Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.</p><p>If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion. See the official <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/provost/policies-resources/university-handbook/fhsecf.html#F80 rel=external target=_blank>K-State Grading Policy</a> for more information. In general, <em>poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade</em>.</p><p>Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/forms/credits_grade_reporting/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.pdf rel=external target=_blank>Incomplete Agreement Form</a>, the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in this course:</p><ol><li><strong>Students who request an incomplete will have their final grade capped at a C</strong>.</li><li>Students will be given a maximum of 8 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester to complete the course. It is expected that students have completed at least half of the course in order to qualify for an incomplete.</li><li>Students understand that access to instructor and TA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations.</li></ol><h3 id=recommended-texts--supplies>Recommended Texts & Supplies</h3><p>Students will make use of <a href=https://github.com/ rel=external target=_blank>GitHub</a> or <a href=https://about.gitlab.com/ rel=external target=_blank>GitLab</a> for source code management.</p><p>Students may use their choice of IDEs and software development platforms. Many of them are available in the Computer Science Department&rsquo;s labs. If a particular software or framework is needed but cannot be acquired, consult with the instructors.</p><h3 id=subject-to-change>Subject to Change</h3><p>The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.</p><h2 id=standard-syllabus-statements>Standard Syllabus Statements</h2><details open class="box cstyle notices info"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i>

Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/honor/ rel=external target=_blank>Honor and Integrity System</a> apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: &ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p><p><strong>For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow, or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.</strong></p><p><strong>This course assumes that all your course work will be done by you. Use of AI text and code generators such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in any submission for this course is strictly forbidden unless explicitly allowed by your instructor. Any unauthorized use of these tools without proper attribution is a violation of the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/honor/basics/pledge.html rel=external target=_blank>K-State Honor Pledge</a>.</strong></p><p>We reserve the right to use various platforms that can perform automatic plagiarism detection by tracking changes made to files and comparing submitted projects against other students&rsquo; submissions and known solutions. That information may be used to determine if plagiarism has taken place.</p><h3 id=students-with-disabilities>Students with Disabilities</h3><p>At K-State it is important that every student has access to course content and the means to demonstrate course mastery. Students with disabilities may benefit from services including accommodations provided by the Student Access Center. Disabilities can include physical, learning, executive functions, and mental health.

Info</summary><div class=box-content><p>This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from <a href=https://online.k-state.edu/student-support/netiquette/ rel=external target=_blank>this statement</a> from K-State Online, and the<a href=https://www.recurse.com/manual rel=external target=_blank>Recurse Center Manual</a>. We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.</p></div></details><p>Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the <em>context</em> and <em>body language</em> of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker <em>means</em>, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.</p><p>Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:</p><ul><li><strong>Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.</strong> Subject lines such as &ldquo;Question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; are not helpful. Subjects such as &ldquo;Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python&rdquo; give plenty of information about your topic.</li><li><strong>Use only one topic per message.</strong> If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.</li><li><strong>Be thorough, concise, and to the point.</strong> Ideally, each message should be a page or less.</li><li><strong>Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.</strong> It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you&rsquo;ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.</li><li><strong>Consider carefully what you write before you post it.</strong> Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.</li><li><strong>If you are lost, don&rsquo;t know an answer, or don&rsquo;t understand something, speak up!</strong> Email and Canvas both allow you to send a message privately to the instructors, so other students won&rsquo;t see that you asked a question. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.</li><li><strong>Class discussions are confidential.</strong> Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.</li><li><strong>Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.</strong> When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.</li><li><strong>Do not use all caps.</strong> It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.</li><li><strong>No feigning surprise.</strong> If someone asks a question, saying things like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.</li><li><strong>No &ldquo;well-actually&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</strong> If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a &ldquo;well, actually&mldr;&rdquo; correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don&rsquo;t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.</li><li><strong>Do not correct someone&rsquo;s grammar or spelling.</strong> Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved.</li><li><strong>Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.</strong> Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.</li><li><strong>Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.</strong> They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.</li></ul><p>As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/ rel=external target=_blank>K-State Principles of Community</a>.</p><h3 id=safezone-ally>SafeZone Ally</h3><p>I am part of the SafeZone community network of trained K-State faculty/staff/students who are available to listen and support you.

Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university&rsquo;s mission.</p><p>Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.</p><h3 id=campus-safety>Campus Safety</h3><p>Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members. In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how to follow any emergency directives. Current Campus Emergency Information is available at the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/advisories/ rel=external target=_blank>University’s Advisory</a> webpage.</p><h3 id=weapons-policy>Weapons Policy</h3><p>Kansas State University prohibits the possession of firearms, explosives, and other weapons on any University campus, with certain limited exceptions, including the lawful concealed carrying of handguns, as provided in the University <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/police/prepare/weapons/ rel=external target=_blank>Weapons Policy</a>.</p><p>You are encouraged to take the <a href=https://kstate.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6zkoPaeDI6g9Sdf rel=external target=_blank>online weapons policy education module</a> to ensure you understand the requirements of the policy, including the requirements related to concealed carrying of handguns on campus. Students possessing a concealed handgun on campus must be lawfully eligible to carry and either at least 21 years of age or a licensed individual who is 18-21 years of age. All carrying requirements of the policy must be observed in this class, including but not limited to the requirement that a concealed handgun be completely hidden from view, securely held in a holster that meets the specifications of the policy, carried without a chambered round of ammunition, and that any external safety be in the “on” position.</p><p>If an individual carries a concealed handgun in a personal carrier such as a backpack, purse, or handbag, the carrier must remain within the individual’s exclusive and uninterrupted control. This includes wearing the carrier with a strap, carrying or holding the carrier, or setting the carrier next to or within the immediate reach of the individual.</p><p>During this course, you will be required to engage in activities, such as interactive examples or sharing work on the whiteboard, that may require you to separate from your belongings, and thus you should plan accordingly.</p><p>Each individual who lawfully possesses a handgun on campus shall be wholly and solely responsible for carrying, storing and using that handgun in a safe manner and in accordance with the law, Board policy and University policy. All reports of suspected violation of the weapons policy are made to the University Police Department by picking up any Emergency Campus Phone or by calling 785-532-6412.</p><h3 id=student-resources>Student Resources</h3><p>K-State has many resources to help contribute to student success.

Research Topic</summary><div class=box-content><p>Starting in Spring 2023, we now have a special track for topics that fall generally under the heading of &ldquo;research&rdquo; instead of a software development project. This includes projects that may have a significant experimental component where the focus is less on developing a software project and more about creating software to support a research task. If you feel that your project fits this description, you should skip to the <a href=/cis598/0-introduction/07-research/index.html>Research Topic</a> page.</p></div></details><h2 id=recommended-timeline>Recommended Timeline</h2><p>Here is a recommended timeline for your project:</p><ul><li>Week 1: Identify a project, get a project advisor.</li><li>Week 2: Report your project topic and advisor. Start developing.</li><li>Week 3: &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; Complete.</li><li>Weeks 3-8: Overview & Requirements Presentations & First Round of Development.</li><li>Week 8: <strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Complete.</strong></li><li>Weeks 9-14: Design Presentations & Second Round of Development.</li><li>Week 14: Schedule Final Presentation & Create Promotional Materials</li><li>Week 15: <strong>Version 1.0 Feature Complete.</strong></li><li>Weeks 15-16: Final Presentations.</li><li>Week 16: Submit Final Materials.</li></ul><h2 id=choosing-a-topic>Choosing a Topic</h2><p>The first major step is to identify a possible topic for your project. It should align with your interests in the field, and it may also fit well with previous courses you&rsquo;ve taken or possibly future career paths. You may also choose to use your project to explore a new topic or framework that you&rsquo;d like to get experience with.</p><p>You are also welcome to choose to try and duplicate an existing program from scratch, putting your own spin on it and writing the code from scratch. For example, you may choose to try and duplicate the underlying code and features for a popular social network - in effect your project is driven by their design, but you have to figure out how to build it and code it yourself.</p><p>Finally, if you are having trouble finding a topic, consult the <strong>Project Ideas</strong> folder on Canvas for project ideas that have been submitted or previous projects that could be continued. You can also chat with the course instructors to get some ideas of a project to consider, or if you have an advisor you&rsquo;d like to work with, chat with them for some ideas.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
Topic Limitations</summary><div class=box-content><p>We do not recommend choosing a project topic that you have no prior knowledge or experience with. For example - do not choose to make a complex video game if you haven&rsquo;t made a game before, either as part of the class or as an independent project. Likewise, do not choose to develop a single-page web application if you don&rsquo;t already know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the basics of web application development.</p><p>Generally students who choose a project topic that requires a large amount of learning end up producing inferior projects simply due to the amount of time spent early in the semester learning the basics. It is best to choose something you already know something about, but would like to explore further.</p></div></details><details open class="box cstyle notices info"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i>
Features to Consider</summary><div class=box-content><p>As you consider project topics, remember that completed projects must include these two items:</p><ul><li><strong>Problem/Solution</strong> In the initial discussion of the project, you should be able to phrase your project as a solution to a selected problem. For example, you could say that the problem is &ldquo;a need for accurate record keeping for a winter warming shelter&rdquo; and that your solution is a &ldquo;web application that is accessible on mobile devices.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Algorithmic Functionality</strong> Each project must include some significant algorithmic component. This means that web applications must do more than just present and store data using the basic CRUD database functions, and video games must have more than just hard-coded levels and enemies. So, be thinking about how you can demonstrate a significant algorithmic component in your project.</li></ul></div></details><details open class="box cstyle notices warning"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
Code First</summary><div class=box-content><p>When selecting your project topic, remember that the goal of this project is to develop a large amount of code as part of a software project. So, if you plan on using tools such as a drag & drop UI creator or a visual game engine such as Unity, you still need to make sure that the bulk of the project is code that you&rsquo;ve written yourself. Any code generated by these tools is not considered a core part of your project since it doesn&rsquo;t demonstrate your programming skill.</p><p>You can demonstrate your skill instead by building UIs directly in code, writing algorithms to automatically generate assets in a video game, or choosing to use a &ldquo;code-first&rdquo; UI design or game engine.</p></div></details><h2 id=finding-an-advisor>Finding an Advisor</h2><p>Once you&rsquo;ve identified a project, you&rsquo;ll need to select a faculty advisor to work with. Throughout the semester, you&rsquo;ll meet regularly to discuss your project with your faculty advisor, and follow their guidance to produce a quality product.</p><p>Typically you want to choose a faculty advisor that is familiar with your project area, since they will be most likely to be able to provide good assistance and feedback as you work on your project.</p><p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure which faculty members may fit well with your project idea, contact the course instructors or consult the information on the <a href=https://cs.ksu.edu/about/people/faculty/ rel=external target=_blank>CS Faculty</a> webpage.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
Advisor Responsibilities</summary><div class=box-content><p>Each advisor approaches senior projects differently, but in general your advisor will typically ask you to do the following:</p><ul><li>Provide an overview of the project and a list of features to be developed.</li><li>Meet weekly to provide status updates on the project.</li><li>Read or review additional information, research papers, etc. related to your project.</li><li>Share your code and other project artifacts for review</li><li>Schedule a final project presentation</li></ul></div></details><h2 id=generative-artificial-intelligence-policy>Generative Artificial Intelligence Policy</h2><details open class="box cstyle notices default" style=--VARIABLE-BOX-color:green><summary class="box-label a11y-only" tabindex=-1><span class=a11y-only>Details</span></summary><div class=box-content><div style=display:block><div style=float:left;padding-right:10px><img src=/cis598/images/0/stoplight_green.png height=120px></div><div><span class="badge cstyle green"><span class=badge-content>GREEN: GenAI Encouraged</span></span> You may make use of GenAI for this project. However, you are expected to produce a project that goes above and beyond what a GenAI agent can accomplish on its own. This project expects significant time and effort on your part to produce a quality project, and GenAI is just one tool you can use to make this possible. You are <b>solely</b> responsible for any artifacts produced for this project and are <b>expected</b> to review any GenAI results to ensure you understand them and that they are accurate. All GenAI usage must be disclosed and cited in your code and presentations.</div></div><div style=clear:both></div><ul><li><strong>Citations Required:</strong> Any usage of GenAI must be noted and cited directly in the work.</li><li><strong>Direct AI Results Allowed:</strong> For this assignment, you <strong>may</strong> include the GenAI results directly in your submission.</li><li><strong>Understand Your Work:</strong> You may be asked to explain your code in detail as part of this project. Failure to do so may be considered a violation of this policy.</li><li><strong>Policy Violations:</strong> Violations may result in a grade of 0 for the assignment and other sanctions approved through the K-State Honor Council.</li></ul></div></details><h2 id=initial-artifacts>Initial Artifacts</h2><p>At the very beginning of your project, you should create a few initial artifacts to start the development process:</p><ul><li><strong>Writeup:</strong> prepare a short, 1 page writeup that describes your project topic. It should give some basic <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case rel=external target=_blank>use cases</a> and a rough idea of the architecture or platforms you plan on using in the project. Your writeup must include clear sections containing the following:<ul><li><strong>Problem/Solution</strong> A clear statement of a problem that you are trying to solve, and how your project will fill the role as a solution to that problem. There are many ways to approach this statement - consult the course instructors for assistance if you are unsure how to phrase your project in this way.</li><li><strong>Use Cases</strong> A list of a few simple use cases that help describe how users will interact with your project.</li><li><strong>Algorithmic Functionality</strong> A clear statement of the intended algorithmic functionality of your project. Your project must include some algorithmic functionality beyond the basics. For example, a web application should provide more than just the basic CRUD database operations. Likewise, a video game should include some complex algorithmic component such as procedurally-generated terrain or a learning AI beyond just simple, hard-coded content.</li><li><strong>Student Qualification</strong> A clear statement explaining why you are qualified to take on this project. You must describe your background and experience with the chosen project and related technologies. <em>If you have no prior experience, consider choosing a different project.</em></li><li><strong>Project Advisor</strong> List your project advisor. <strong>You must have permission from your advisor confirming that they will supervise your project before submitting!</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Feature Lists:</strong> prepare three sets of feature lists for your project:<ul><li><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong> or <em>must haves</em>: these are features that must be present in the project for it to function in the basic sense. It usually doesn&rsquo;t include much in the way of user interface beyond the basic interactions, and it may be missing some additional items to make it more useable. A project that has these features could be considered a Minimum Viable Product. Typically you want to have these features completed in the first 8 weeks of development.</li><li><strong>Version 1.0</strong> or <em>should haves</em>: these are features that should be present in the project for it to be considered complete. This would involve additional usability features or links to other APIs as needed. A project with these features would be considered a 1.0 product, and could be used by others. Typically these features are completed in the second 8 weeks of development.</li><li><strong>Version 2.0</strong> or <em>would like to haves</em>: these are cool features that would be useful to have in a finalized project, but they may be outside the scope of what is achievable in a single semester. The lack of these features should not impact the useability or functionality of the project. Typically these features are simply listed on the &ldquo;Future Work&rdquo; portion of the final presentation, but if you complete the project ahead of schedule you may consider adding one or more of these features to the project.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Time Management Plan:</strong> prepare a detailed time management plan for each week of the semester. This helps ensure that you are able to devote 9 hours each week to this class, and also ensures that you save enough time for other classes and activities.</li></ul><p>These artifacts are not &ldquo;set in stone&rdquo; and can be easily adjusted throughout the project. For example, you may find that a feature previously on the Version 2.0 list is not critical, and it moves to an earlier list.</p><h2 id=hello-world>Hello World</h2><p>The next step in creating a successful project is getting to the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; stage. This typically involves configuring your development environment, creating a new project or downloading an existing project, and confirming that you can successfully build and run the project in its simplest form. Ideally, you should be at the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; stage of your project <strong>no later than week 3</strong>, and ideally much sooner. This is especially important if you are learning how to use a new framework, programming language, or tool, as it may require significant work to get to this stage alone.</p><p>Once you are at the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; stage, you are at the point where you can start adding features to your project from the feature lists described above. A great way to think of those feature lists is like the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog rel=external target=_blank>Product Backlog</a> in the agile software methodology - it is a list of project requirements to be completed.</p><details open class="box cstyle notices warning"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
Warning</summary><div class=box-content><h2 id=onedrive-is-not-good-for-code---use-git>OneDrive is NOT good for code - use git!</h2><p>One common issue that students run into in this class is storing their code repository folders in a folder synched with OneDrive causes issues - especially if you use OneDrive to sync your work between multiple systems. This can cause all sorts of headaches since OneDrive wasn&rsquo;t designed to work well with code, and large projects can result in thousands of text files that need to be constantly synched and updated as you make changes. It is further exacerbated by putting a <code>git</code> repository inside of a OneDrive folder - that is a recipe for your <code>git</code> repository to become corrupted and potentially unrecoverable if a sync error occurs.</p><p>Instead, you should always store your code repository folders outside of anything synched to OneDrive (I like to just make a <code>projects</code> folder inside of my profile folder on my system, so the path would be <code>C:\users\russfeld\projects</code> or <code>/home/russfeld/projects</code>) and work from there. Inside of that folder, you should clone your GitHub Classroom repository that has already been set up for you and start working from there. If you&rsquo;ve already created a project, you&rsquo;ll need to manually copy the code into that folder and commit it - you can&rsquo;t push an existing repository to GitHub Classroom without causing major issues.</p><p>Also, if you haven&rsquo;t created a <code>.gitignore</code> file for your project, now is a great time to do so. You should <strong>never</strong> commit binary files, build artifacts, or external libraries to your GitHub repository - that just causes unnecessary repository bloat and makes things much harder to deal with down the road. There is a GitHub repository full of sample <code>.gitignore</code> files for just about every IDE and framework imaginable - see <a href=https://github.com/github/gitignore rel=external target=_blank>https://github.com/github/gitignore</a>.</p></div></details><details open class="box cstyle notices tip"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
Tip</summary><div class=box-content><h2 id=project-scale-and-scope>Project Scale and Scope</h2><p>One area that many students struggle with is finding a project that has the appropriate scale and scope for a senior project. While there are no clear rules for this, and each student&rsquo;s situation is different, here are some suggestions for finding an appropriately sized project.</p><ul><li>The course is 3 credit hours, which roughly equates to an expectation of 9 hours of work each week. Across a 16 week semester, that comes to a total of 144 hours, or just over three and a half 40 hour work weeks if you worked on it full time. You&rsquo;ll be tracking your hours worked throughout the semester, and that may help you make sure you are spending enough time on your project.</li><li>If you are working in a new framework or language, you should work completely through the initial tutorial in the first couple of weeks of class. Your finished project must go significantly beyond what is covered in the tutorial.</li><li>Typically projects will have 3-4 major features that make up the minimum viable product, and another 3-4 major features for version 1.0. Each feature should require 1-2 weeks of effort to implement.</li><li>Your advisor and course instructors can help you determine if your proposed project has appropriate scope, or if it needs modification. You should consult with them early on in the process, and continually update them on your progress, especially if your planned features change.</li></ul></div></details><h2 id=next-steps>Next Steps</h2><p>At this point, you should be well into development on your project.

Presentation Diagrams</summary><div class=box-content><p>While the focus of this presentation is the design of your project, you don&rsquo;t need to include an excruciating level of detail in your design diagrams. This makes them very difficult to see and understand in your presentation, and represents a large amount of unnecessary effort on your part. Some suggestions:</p><ul><li>For UML class diagrams, focus on the overall structure of your application and the relationships between classes, and not on exhaustively listing all attributes and methods in each class. It should be very clear if your application is constructed following a particular design pattern, such as MVC. If your diagram includes many classes, you may wish to start by showing the overall picture and then zooming in on particular areas on later slides to give more detail.</li><li>For database entity relationship Diagrams, similar to UML class diagrams, focus on the overall structure and relationships between tables, and not exhaustively listing all attributes for each table. You may choose to show a few attributes for each table, or include simplified table names in your diagram to make it clear what each table contains. It should be easy to find the 1 to 1, 1 to many, and many to many relationships in your application.</li><li>For API documentation diagrams, it may be easier to simply list a few API endpoints and briefly describe what that endpoint does or returns. You don&rsquo;t need to include a list of all possible options or ways to use each endpoint.</li><li>For UML sequence diagrams, we recommend <strong>only</strong> including them if you have an interesting sequence to show - don&rsquo;t include one just to have one. In most cases, you don&rsquo;t need to show things that are generally understood, such as the process of saving a file to a disk or making a request in a web application. Interesting sequences might include the steps taken during program startup to initialize data, a complex authentication process for a web application, or the the process that happens when a special event is triggered in a video game.</li></ul></div></details><h2 id=additional-content-to-include>Additional Content to Include</h2><p>In addition to the basic outline listed above, here is a list of some other topics you may wish to cover in your presentation, especially if it is relevant to your project:</p><ul><li>The current status of the project</li><li>A brief initial demo of the project</li></ul><h2 id=generative-artificial-intelligence-policy>Generative Artificial Intelligence Policy</h2><details open class="box cstyle notices default" style=--VARIABLE-BOX-color:orange><summary class="box-label a11y-only" tabindex=-1><span class=a11y-only>Details</span></summary><div class=box-content><div style=display:block><div style=float:left;padding-right:10px><img src=/cis598/images/0/stoplight_yellow.png height=120px></div><div><span class="badge cstyle orange"><span class=badge-content>YELLOW: Limited GenAI Usage Allowed</span></span> For your presentations, you may make limited use of GenAI tools to help with slide design and graphics.
