      <description>Slides
The major outcome for this course is a project that demonstrates your skills in computer science, software development, and other areas relevant to your chosen degree program. This page provides an overview that will help you get started on your project.
Research Topic Starting in Spring 2023, we now have a special track for topics that fall generally under the heading of &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; instead of a software development project. This includes projects that may have a significant experimental component where the focus is less on developing a software project and more about creating software to support a research task.</description>

      <description>Every two weeks throughout the semester, you are expected to do the following:
Meet with your project advisor, either in person or via Zoom, to provide them with a clear update on your project. Ideally, you should be showing them code or working prototypes, not just a quick verbal update. They are here to provide help but need to know exactly what is going on in your project. Discuss issues, questions, and next steps with your advisor during the meeting.</description>

      <description>During the first half of the semester, each student will be scheduled to give a Overview &amp;amp; Requirements Presentation related to the project.
Presentation Outline The presentation should be roughly 8 minutes in length, and cover the following topics:
A brief overview of the project. NEW A small set (2-3) of top level use cases for the project. These use cases should clearly lead to the requirements in the next bullet point.</description>

      <description>At the end of the semester, each student will give a public Final Presentation that presents all aspects of the completed project.
Overview The presentation should be roughly 30-45 minutes in length, and cover all aspects of the project. A recommended outline is below:
Introduction Background &amp;amp; Related Work Project Requirements Design Documents Project Implementation (Languages, Frameworks, Code Structure) Testing &amp;amp; Evaluation Packaging &amp;amp; Deployment (if applicable) Live Demo Future Work Conclusion Q&amp;amp;A Scheduling Final presentations are typically scheduled during the last week of the semester (sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;dead week&amp;rdquo;) or finals week.</description>

      <title>Final Artifacts</title>

      <description>At the end of the semester, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to submit all of your project artifacts and information for grading. Here is a helpful checklist of everything that should be submitted:
Initial Writeup &amp;amp; Feature List (collected via Canvas early in the semester) First Presentation (collected via Canvas when it was presented) Second Presentation (collected via Canvas when it was presented) Advertisement Materials (collected via Canvas before final presentation) All Code &amp;amp; Related Resources Pushed to GitHub Classroom Repository Repository should include a README.</description>

      <title>Research Project</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/0-introduction/07-research/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis598/0-introduction/07-research/index.html</guid>
      <description>This course includes a special project track for projects that are considered more &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; than purely software development. Some examples:
Exploring how to use artificial intelligence to play a simulated game or recognize images Developing a software tool to interface with lab equipment that requires a large amount of trial and error Writing a tool that uses data science techniques to analyze data and answer a question or hypothesis Developing a new educational software tool, where the major focus of the project is collecting user feedback and analyzing results to continuously improve the software.</description>
